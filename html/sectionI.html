    <h3>Section I: General Starting Class Overview</h3>
    <p>
        This is just a very generalized overview to give some idea of what each class is all about. More details, such as what stats
        to prioritize or what exact abilities everyone gets, will be covered in later sections on actual character builds.
        I'm generally assuming that the reader already knows the basic mechanics of the game, such as what each stat does,
        what the difference between defense and armour is, what fatigue is, etc. If you don't, then you may want to read
        up on that first.

    <h4 class="warrior" id="warrior">The Warrior [DAOS1.1]</h4>
    <p class="warrior">
        Warriors are largely what you'd expect from an RPG - they are the most versatile weaponry specialists of any base class,
        able to learn all three melee styles (sword and shield, dual wielding, and two-handed weapons) as well as archery.
        Their class-specific talent tree allows them to make better use of heavier armour than anyone else, improves their
        performance when they're engaging large numbers of enemies, and gives them some control over the degree to which
        enemies will prioritize them as a target, which is particularly important for warriors filling the tank role. However,
        you shouldn't go into the warrior class expecting them to be the easiest class to play, as they tend to be in many
        other RPGs. Like rogues and mages, warriors require strategy to use well and can't simply go charging head-on into
        any battle they encounter, as tempting as that might be. In general, warriors will be at the forefront, but recklessness
        and/or lack of preparation can rapidly result in defeat and death. <br />
        Pros: </br>
        + High HP </br>
        + Best heavy armour users </br>
        + Large weapon selection 
        + Work relatively well on AI 'auto-pilot' <br />
        + Can achieve very high damage output across a wide variety
        of battlefield conditions <br />
        Cons: <br />
        - Smaller bag of tricks than the other classes <br />
        - Greater need to manage stamina due
        to fatigue <br />
        - Not as sturdy as warriors in a lot of RPGs; caution and tactics still required to survive <br />
        - More one-dimensional than the other classes<br />
    </p>
    <h4 class="rogue"id="rogue">1.2 - The Rogue [DAOS1.2]</h4>
    <p class="rogue">
        Rogues provide a broad blend of damage, crowd control, support, and general utility. While not as sturdy or well suited to
        heavy armour as the warrior, rogues have a nice bag of tricks that gives them as much (or even more) survivability
        as their meaty frontline friends. Rogues probably require the most positional tactics of any class type, scouting
        ahead to clear out hazards or assassinate particularly dangerous targets before the rest of the group charges in,
        staying on the move and making use of battlefield positioning to maximize their impact. Rogues are more limited in
        their selection of fighting styles than warriors, typically using either dual wielding, archery, or some combination
        of the two. However, because of their class mechanics, rogues are generally regarded as being better than warriors
        at both of these styles of combat. There's almost never a time when you won't want at least one rogue in your group,
        if only to clear out traps and pick locks. <br />
        Pros: <br />
        + A lot of versatility in roles and combat style + Tons of utility<br />
        + Great survivability if built correctly <br />
        + Best skill users of any class <br />
        Cons: <br />
        - Generally relegated to using light
        armour <br />
        - Less margin of error than warriors due to lower hp and less armour <br />
        - Require somewhat more micromanagement<br />
        than warriors to be effective 
        - Limited weapon selection <br />
        - Tend to be defensively weak and vulnerable in the early
        game<br />
    </p>
    <h4 class="mage" id="mage"> 1.3 - The Mage [DAOS1.3]</h4>
    <p class="mage">
        If you 've played BioWare RPGs before, you're probably expecting the mage to be a complete and utter powerhouse. If so, you
        guessed correctly. Mages have the most raw power of any class, in addition to having an enormous bag of tricks for
        keeping themselves alive against the odds and horribly incapacitating and mangling even the strongest enemies. Many
        of their spells are extremely potent on their own, but the spell combo mechanic can ramp up the destruction to even
        greater levels. For sheer battlefield control and dominance, nothing exceeds the potential of a mage. They also make
        excellent group support characters, and can even be melee tanks if you pick the Arcane Warrior specialization (more
        on that later). <br />
        Pros: <br />
        + Far and away the highest damage output of any class <br />
        + The only class that can heal <br />
        + Enormously potent spell combinations <br />
        + Surprisingly high survivability and crowd control with the right spells 
        + Can become the heaviest armour tanks in the game with the Arcane Warrior specialization <br />
        Cons: <br />
        - Require the most micromanagement of any class to be effective, unless you just use them as a healbot <br />
        - Low hit point pool and poor armour, so positioning and defensive spells are necessary for survival <br />
        - Very little equipment variety <br />
        - Actually kind of too strong; have a lot of overpowered abilities and tricks that can trivialize encounters that would otherwise be very challenging. <br />
