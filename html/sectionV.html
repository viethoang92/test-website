<h3>Building and Developing Your Team</h3>
<p>

In general, there's a ton of flexibility in how you put together your team in 
this game, as you can make just about any team work provided you use the 
right strategic tactics with each. Typical teams include at least one 
character who can serve as a tank, as you will likely have at least one or 
two party mates who can't survive very well if they draw a lot of enemy 
hostility and will need to be protected. A well-geared and well-built tank 
can be a real lifesaver in many situations, particularly ambushes and other 
scripted encounters where you start in a disadvantageous position. You 
generally also want to bring at least one rogue character along, since 
picking locks gets you extra exp and loot to sell as well as occasionally 
valuable bits of gear and consumables, and being able to stealth ahead and 
disarm a room full of traps before the rest of your party engages the enemy 
can save you an absolute ton of grief (not to mention the exp you get from 
trap disarmament). Most people bring along at least one mage, since magical 
healing is a tremendous boon and no one can handle AoE havoc like a mage. The 
final party slot is pretty much up to you, and even the three aforementioned 
characters are quite negotiable if you come up with tactics that take their 
absence into account - for instance, I play almost exclusively mageless these 
days.
<br><br>
In this section, I'll go through all of the permanent NPC allies you can add 
to your party in the game (in roughly the order that you're likely to 
encounter them) and the builds I've found suit them best based on their 
initial stat, talent, and specialization loadout. Several arcs at the 
beginning of the game (origin stories, Ostagar) will give you temporary NPC 
allies - in general, just look at the talents they have and pick the most 
appropriate tactics. For instance, Ser Jory is a two-hander, so set him to 
Scrapper. Daveth, on the other hand, is a rogue with archery talents, so 
setting him to Archer with Ranged behaviour is a good option. Note that all 
permanent allies except for Dog have a bonus stat that increases as their 
approval for the Warden rises - you get bonuses at 25, 50, 75, and 90 approval.
</p>
<h4>5.1 - Alistair [DAOS5.1]</h4>
<p>
Race: Human
Base Class: Warrior
Specialization: Templar
Most Appropriate Build Archetype(s): Tank
Best Default Tactic Set(s): Defender
Romance?: Yes (Female Warden only)
Bonus Stat: Constitution
Where to get him: Automatically joins at Ostagar
Gift Hint: He might crack jokes all the time, but his taste in objects is 
definitely stonier.
<br><br>
Unless you started as a Human Noble, Alistair will be the first permanent 
ally you find. In general, Alistair is a 'good' character, in that he wants 
you to act in a just and honourable fashion. His Templar background makes him 
a bit mistrustful of mages, particularly Blood Mages and other maleficar; in 
spite of that, though, he's not particularly religious despite the context of 
his upbringing.
<br><br>
Alistair tends to work best being built as a tank, because he comes preloaded 
with a bunch of Shield tree talents (though not the really critical ones, 
unfortunately - you'll have to wait a few levels for that). However, because 
you get him at a relatively early level, Alistair is a bit more malleable 
than your other warrior allies and can be put satisfactorily into any warrior-
class role. Nonetheless, it's advisable that you follow the tank build for 
him, as it tends to yield rather nice results. Good 2nd specialization 
choices for Alistair are Champion (for group buffing and helping him dodge 
even better) and Reaver (for increasing his ability to draw hostility and to 
add a little self-healing capability).
<br><br>
Pros
+ Great tank in the mid to end game
+ Has some rather amusing dialogue throughout the game
+ Great control over his character development due to how early you get him
<br><br>
Cons
- Can be a little 'high maintenance' for some key plot choices, losing 
approval if he's along for them
- Comes with a slightly silly initial talent setup for a tank (e.g. no Shield 
Wall - what were they thinking?)
</p>
<h4>5.2 - Morrigan [DAOS5.2]</h4>

Race: Human
Base Class: Mage
Specialization: Shapeshifter
Most Appropriate Build Archetype(s): Nuker, Debilitator
Best Default Tactic Set(s): Damager, Debilitator, Controller
Romance?: Yes (Male Warden only)
Bonus Stat: Magic
Where to get her: She will automatically join after Ostagar
Gift Hint: She might be a no-nonsense Witch of the Wilds, but she's a 
material girl at heart.
<br><br>
Morrigan has gained a lot of notoriety for being difficult to please, but 
really, it just involves developing a true understanding of her character. 
Morrigan, while definitely not a 'good' character, per se, is not evil 
either. Instead, she just takes a hard-line view of things based on pure 
logic and pragmatism, in which you should always be looking out for yourself 
first and foremost and not doing things that don't result in some kind of 
gain for your efforts. As both someone rooted in evidence-based logic and a 
maleficar, she has a strong disdain for the Chantry and its religion, and 
particularly the Templars. She has pity for those who have their freedom 
taken against their will, but despises those whom she sees as being weak, 
willing accomplices in their own imprisonment, hence her scorn for the Circle 
of Magi. Favour cold practicality over sentiment, and you'll have Morrigan on 
your side.
<br><br>
Morrigan comes pre-loaded in a way that suggests playing her as a blend of 
damage and debilitating effects. Her initial specialization is unfortunately 
not too helpful, but her cold-based and electrical-based spells are both 
potent and predispose her to heading down the path to Storm of the Century 
for enormous AoE chaos, and she has some solid debuffing abilities as well. 
However, being a mage, she is quite flexible and can be adapted to serve a 
support role or even to be an Arcane Warrior when she reaches level 14. 
Morrigan is definitely one of the more versatile characters in the game, as 
mages tend to be. Any of the three remaining mage specializations can be a 
good choice for Morrigan depending on what role you would like her to play.
<br><br>
Pros:
+ Immensely powerful damage character
+ High versatility in build and spell choices
+ Scathing sarcasm makes for some great dialogue moments
<br><br>
Cons:
- Very high maintenance for retaining approval during a lot of plot choices
- Poor initial specialization choice
- Her unique robes are horribly skanky
<br><br>
<h4>5.3 - The Dog [DAOS5.3] (Actually, you get to pick his name)</h4>

Race: Mabari warhound
Base Class: Unique
Specialization: N/A
Most Appropriate Build Archetype(s): N/A (see below)
Best Default Tactic Set(s): War Dog
Romance?: No. Don't be sick.
Bonus Stat: None. Aw.
Where to get him: Automatically joins you during the Human Noble origin, or 
can optionally join in a random encounter after Ostagar depending on your 
previous choices.
Gift Hint: Dog already comes with 100 unwavering Approval, but you can give 
him bones to make his chances of finding items in areas much higher.
<br><br>
The dog is an interesting character, acting as a sort of mishmosh of tank, 
melee DPS, and crowd control. He can be a very potent ally in the early game, 
but unfortunately rapidly loses relevance in the later game due to his 
extremely limited gear selection. If you talk to him in the various areas you 
visit, you can ask him to go search for items, which can include gear pieces, 
codex entries, gift items, and money. He is the ultimate in unjudgemental 
loyalty, standing by you no matter what choices you make in the game. The dog 
can only wear two pieces of equipment that are unique to him: collars and 
warpaints, covered below. 
<br><br>
I feel that the dog can go two ways in terms of stat builds.
<br><br>
Build 1: Strength focus
<br><br>
This build tries to maximize the dog's damage output by putting the majority 
of your stat points into Strength, with a few extras put into Constitution. 
Because this loadout gives the dog almost no dodging ability and because he 
will only be able to attain armour absorption roughly equivalent to leather, 
you don't want the dog to be tanking in this build. Only use this if you are 
confident of your ability to keep hostility off of him; the Constitution 
won't help him much if he gets swarmed - it's mostly just there to help him 
survive AoEs and to let him survive if one or two enemies break off from your 
tank. For this, I'd usually go 2:1 STR:CON on level-ups or something similar.
<br><br>
Build 2: STR/DEX split
<br><br>
This build gives the dog a lot more survivability at the expense of raw 
damage output. In this build, I usually go roughly equal between Strength and 
Dexterity. This allows the dog to offtank a lot more effectively, though he 
still won't be a great dodger the way rogues and shieldtanks are.
<br><br>
Pros
+ Has some great tricks up his sleeve in the early game, like Dread Howl
+ Overwhelm is awesome, especially for magekilling
+ Doesn't require any approval management
+ Cheap to gear and remove injuries from
+ Some of the stuff he finds is pretty useful
<br><br>
Cons
- Extremely limited gear selection greatly hinders his performance in the mid 
to late game
- Limited talent selection relative to other characters
- Extremely poor armour penetration
- No runes due to not having a weapon
- The only melee character with no way to gain or lose hostility
- No bonus stat points
<br><br>
Noteworthy Gear
<br><br>
COLLARS
<br><br>
Mabari War Harness
+4 Armour penetration
+8 Armour
Where to get it: Circle Tower
<br><br>
This collar is the better choice for people wanting to build the dog as a 
damager, as 8 armour is the most you can find on collars and the armour 
penetration bonus helps compensate for an area in which the dog is painfully 
lacking. You can also find it for free.
<br><br>
Pure Bitch Braid
+8 Attack
+8 Armour
Where to get it: an optional fight in the Urn of Sacred Ashes arc
<br><br>
An alternative to the War Harness, I feel it's a little less useful overall 
but may be a good choice if you feel like the dog is missing his opponents 
too often.
<br><br>
Warpaint
<br><br>
Kaddis of the Courser
+2 Dexterity
12 Strength required
Where to get it: bought from Barlin in Lothering
<br><br>
A good choice if you're going for the STR/DEX split build.
<br><br>
Kaddis of the Lady of the Skies
+30 Physical resistance
10 Strength required
Where to get it: from the Circle Tower
<br><br>
A good all-around choice, helping the dog to shrug off some obnoxious status 
effects. As an additional perk, you can get it for free.
<br><br>
Kaddis of the Trickster
+3 Damage
12 Strength required
Where to get it: bought from Alimar in Dust Town
<br><br>
Probably the best choice if your aim is to maximize the dog's damage output.
<br><br>
Warpaint of the Vanguard
+1 Stamina regeneration in combat
12 Strength required
Where to get it: bought from Barlin in Lothering
<br><br>
A decent choice for allowing the dog to use his talents more rapidly, though 
I found he usually had enough stamina to do his job in all but the longest 
fights.
<br><br>
<h4>5.4 - Leliana [DAOS5.4]</h4>

Race: Human
Base Class: Rogue
Specialization: Bard
Most Appropriate Build Archetype(s): Rogue Archer
Best Default Tactic Set(s): Archer
Romance?: Yes (either gender)
Bonus Stat: Cunning
Where to get her: Can be recruited in Lothering
Gift Hint: She's very devout, but also a bit of a girly-girl. Talk to her to 
find out more.
<br><br>
Leliana is a devout follower of Andraste and the Maker, even if it's not 
quite in the way the Chantry would like. She's a sweet-natured lady with a 
complicated past, who can bring all sorts of useful rogue and bard skills to 
your party. In general, like Alistair, Leliana prefers for the Warden to be 
'good', and particularly values mercy, redemption, and reverence for the 
things she holds holy. She's definitely not above killing when the situation 
calls for it, though, and she has a good eye for spies and traitors.
<br><br>
Leliana generally works best as a rogue archer, as she starts with a bunch of 
archery talents and not much by way of dual wielding. She is a bard, so she 
does a good job of buffing your group, and her Cunning shouldn't be 
neglected - some blend of Dexterity and Cunning, probably a little heavier on 
the Dexterity to give her better accuracy and survivability (she'll get a 
fair bit of Cunning from her stat bonuses), is a good idea. She comes 
preloaded with some lockpicking/disarming talents, which is great, but no 
stealth, which kind of sucks. For a second specialization, the best choices 
would be Duelist for more accuracy and dodging, or Ranger to have disposable 
summons supplement your party in various ways.
<br><br>
Pros:
+ Starts as a pretty good utility rogue, as her mechanical talents and high 
Cunning make her a great lockpicker and trap remover
+ Early access to the Bard specialization makes for a nice boost to your party
+ Combination of Bard skills and archery abilities make her a terrific 
endgame support and damage character, particularly once you get Lethality
<br><br>
Cons:
- No Stealth skills, so using her as an advance scout requires some remedial 
talent points
- A wee bit on the crazy side; party dialogue tends not to be terribly 
interesting
- A little slow to get started because of how many talents she needs to truly 
start shining
<br><br>
<h4>5.5 - Sten [DAOS5.5]</h4>

Sten
Race: Qunari
Base Class: Warrior
Specialization: None (boo!)
Most Appropriate Build Archetype(s): Two-Hander
Best Default Tactic Set(s): Scrapper
Romance?: No
Bonus Stat: Strength
Where to get him: Can be recruited in Lothering
Gift Hint: He might be a gruff military man, but Sten has an appreciation for 
culture and the finer things in life.
<br><br>
Sten is a warrior of the Beresaad and a stalwart follower of the Qun, the non-
deist life philosophies of the Qunari religion. It's kind of cool to see a 
religion in a fantasy setting that isn't deist for a change. Sten has a 
pretty different character dynamic from your other characters in that he 
doesn't want you to be nice to him and doesn't necessarily want you to agree 
with him - what he wants is a strong leader whom he can trust with his life 
and whom he can follow with confidence to victory. Sometimes, putting Sten in 
his place when he questions you can actually make him respect you more, where 
being placating only earns his scorn. Sten has an inherent dislike of mages 
and magic in general, which colours his reaction to various plot choices, and 
generally prefers fighting to talking.
<br><br>
Sten is mostly kitted out as a two-hander DPS warrior with some off-tanking 
abilities. He generally won't be quite as sturdy as Alistair, though his bonus 
stat in Strength can help him equip heavier armour sooner rather than later 
and helps him with his damage-dealing abilities. Because you get him 
relatively early, you can conceivably shift him into a different build 
archetype, but it will probably weaken him in the long run. Give him the 
biggest weapon you can find and some decent armour, boost his Strength with 
some Constitution added into the mix, and watch him go.
<br><br>
Pros:
+ A solid set of starting feats for being a two-hander damager
+ Surprisingly funny dialogue
+ Very easy to gain influence with once you unlock his personal quest
<br><br>
Cons:
- Only gets one specialization rather than two
- Can be a bit high maintenance with some plot choices, particularly with 
those having to do with magic
- From a stats perspective, Sten is outclassed by Oghren in just about every way

<h4>5.6 - Zevran [DAOS5.6]</h4>

Race: Elf
Base Class: Rogue
Specialization: Assassin
Most Appropriate Build Archetype(s): Rogue Dual Wielder
Best Default Tactic Set(s): Scrapper
Romance?: Yes (either gender)
Bonus Stat: Dexterity
Where to get him: Can be recruited after a random encounter upon completion 
of your first major army recruitment quest
Gift Hint: Zevran would die of joy if he ever got the key to Fort Knox.
<br><br>
A former Antivan Crow, Zevran is a skilled assassin with a silver tongue and 
an insatiable libido. While Zevran generally likes the idea of being good and 
doing the right thing, he frequently finds that doing is not really the best 
way to get the job done, and getting the job done is always paramount. His 
morals are pretty flexible, and in general, he will be an uncritical and low-
maintenance character to have along with you. Even when he occasionally 
voices an objection to your course of action, you can usually get out of it 
with no actual loss of approval from him. Dangerous, flirty, and devil-may-
care, Zevran will cheerfully accompany you into the maw of hell, so long as 
you don't get too pushy or nosy.
<br><br>
Zev is designed to make use of the dual wield talent tree, having gotten a 
couple talents from it already and being an Assassin. The fact that he starts 
with Momentum is terrific, though some of his other dual wield trees are a 
bit sickly and will need to be bulked up sooner rather than later to have him 
performing up to snuff. His stealth skills are very good, but unfortunately, 
he comes with no mechanical talents whatsoever, so you have to wait several 
levels after he joins you until he'll be a decent lockpicker and trap 
disarmer. Generally, you're going to want to stack Zevran with a ton of 
Dexterity, aided by his stat bonuses. Cunning is helpful too to give a bit of 
a boost to some of his Assassin talents and to help with 
lockpicking/disarmament. The Duelist specialization is generally the best fit 
for Zev as a 2nd specialization to help his dodging and give him some 
additional striking power, though Bard can work fine too, especially if 
you've raised his Cunning a lot to get more damage output out of Assassin 
talents.
<br><br>
Pros:
+ Starts with great damage output potential and strategic abilities
+ Low-maintenance in terms of approval of your actions; quite easy to gain 
his approval
+ Can make a passable archer in a pinch due to very high Dexterity
+ Fun personality with great dialogue
+ Can have very high survivability in the endgame due to dodging, especially 
with the right gear
<br><br>
Cons:
- Extremely fragile at first without some careful micromanagement
- Starts with no lockpick/trap disarming talents
- Takes time to really come into his own because of how many talents he needs 
to hit his stride

<h4>5.7 - Wynne [DAOS5.7]</h4>

Race: Human
Base Class: Mage
Specialization: Spirit Healer
Most Appropriate Build Archetype(s): Support Healer
Best Default Tactic Set(s): Healer, Supporter
Romance?: No
Bonus Stat: Willpower
Where to get her: Can be recruited during the Broken Circle quest
Gift Hint: Wynne might be getting on in years, but she's a lifelong learner.
<br><br>
Wynne is a senior enchanter with the Circle of Magi, highly experienced in 
both the scholarly and practical aspects of magic. Because of her long stints 
as a mentor to young mages, she has the demeanour of a motherly advisor, 
trying to guide those younger and less experienced than her onto what she 
feels is the correct path and to keep them from danger and temptation. She 
wishes for the Warden to be a 'good' person, acting in an honourable and 
upstanding fashion, and despite being a mage, she does not harbour any ill 
will toward the Templars or the Chantry.
<br><br>
Wynne starts out kitted in a way that makes the Support Healer build an 
obvious choice. Her spell choices and her specialization, coupled with her 
ample tactic slots, make her amazingly good in this role right from the 
moment you recruit her, even if Broken Circle is your first major recruitment 
quest. Being a mage, Wynne is quite versatile and can definitely pick up 
damage or debilitation spells, but she truly shines as a healer and group 
supporter. Her bonus stats will help give her an ample supply of mana, though 
investment in Willpower as well as Magic when she levels up is still a good 
idea, and a little Constitution to help her stay alive long enough to cast 
her healing spells is never a bad idea either. Though it seems anti-thematic, 
Blood Mage makes a decent second specialization for Wynne because of its 
useful bonuses, and she can work decently as an Arcane Warrior too.
<br><br>
Pros:
+ An excellent support mage right off the bat
+ Relatively low maintenance for approval so long as you're not obviously 
underhanded, though gaining approval will mostly rely on gifts
+ Flexible, though not quite as much as Morrigan
+ Starts with a huge number of tactic slots
<br><br>
Cons:
- Starts with no Combat Training skill ranks, meaning her spellcasts can be 
interrupted quite easily early on
- Can be a little preachy and overbearing in her 'mentor' role
- Dialogue is pretty unremarkable
<br><br>
<h4>5.8 - Shale [DAOS5.8]</h4>

Race: Stone Golem
Base Class: Warrior
Specialization: N/A (see below)
Most Appropriate Build Archetype(s): Unique (see below)
Best Default Tactic Set(s): generally Defender or Scrapper depending on build
Romance?: No. Unsurprisingly.
Bonus Stat: Strength
Where to get her: can be recruited in Honnleath (requires The Stone Prisoner 
DLC)
Gift Hint: Shale's appearance tells you most of what you need to know when it 
comes to finding gifts for her.
<br><br>
Shale is, quite obviously, a big golem. She has a rather different 
perspective from your other party members, as she has existed for a very long 
period of time, well beyond the lifespan of any mortal race. In addition, up 
until you recruit her, she had spent the entirety of her remembered existence 
as a thrall to whoever possessed her control rod, with no true free will or 
power over her life and actions. After a few decades of being stuck as a 
decorative statue in Honnleath, she's ready for a change of scenery, with 
some bird massacres along the way.
<br><br>
Shale is a highly unique character in terms of builds. Like the dog, she has 
only two pieces of gear: small crystals for weapons, and large crystals for 
armour, however these tend to give much more powerful bonuses than the dog's 
collars and warpaints do. Shale is technically a warrior in that she gets the 
basic warrior talent tree, but does not get any of the weapon-specific trees; 
instead, she gets four unique talent paths, each of which begins with a 
sustained ability. Further talents in each path enhance the bonuses granted 
by that sustained ability as well as granting new abilities. Thus, Shale is 
capable of serving as a main tank, a melee damage dealer, or a group 
supporter depending on which of her modes is active. Her build will depend at 
least in part on which role you foresee yourself using most often. Shale does 
not gain access to the warrior class specializations.
<br><br>
Path 1: The Pulverizing Blows Tree
<br><br>
This talent set is basically designed to maximize Shale's melee damage 
output, granting large bonuses to raw damage and armour penetration, with the 
drawback being a drop in dodging ability. To utilize this mode to the 
maximum, you'll want lots of Strength, with excess points put into either 
Constitution (Shale already has boatloads of it, so this basically allows 
Shale to offtank by outlasting enemies), Dexterity (to help dodging), and/or 
Willpower (to help Shale keep up continuous active talent use)
<br><br>
Recommended crystal type: Fire (for raw damage), Lightning (for damage plus 
dodging), Ice (vs heavily armoured targets)
<br><br>
Path 2: The Stoneheart Tree
<br><br>
This is Shale's tanking talent line, giving large bonuses to armour, health 
and stamina regeneration, elemental resistances, and increased hostility 
toward Shale from enemies. For this build, you really only need enough 
Strength to equip Shale's top grade small crystals - everything else should 
be going into Constitution (to make the most of Shale's innate regeneration 
and high armour absorption) or Dexterity (to try and get a bit of dodging in, 
though it's not really Shale's forté), with perhaps a sprinkling of Willpower 
to help her keep up active talent use. Shale is excellent at holding 
hostility in this mode, at least as good as a full shieldtank warrior, if not 
better, particularly against single targets like bosses.
<br><br>
Recommended crystal type: Nature (for improved armour, hp, and regen), 
Lightning (for better dodging), Spirit (for better all-around stats and magic 
resistance)
<br><br>
Path 3: The Rock Mastery Tree
<br><br>
Shale's quirkiest and most situational talent set, it acts as a sort of 
hybrid of damage dealing and group buffing. More specifically, while in this 
mode, Shale grants buffs to ranged attack speed and critical chance to any 
nearby party members, and gains a bonus to defense against missile attacks. 
In addition, Shale is less likely to be attacked by enemies while in this 
mode. However, it comes with fairly steep penalties - lowered defense, 
armour, and melee critical chance. Shale gets a few ranged attack talents, 
but her normal autoattacks in this mode are still melee. This is mostly 
useful for when you have a party with a lot of archers, or just to flip on in 
very specific instances (like the Arcane Horror sub-boss in the Brecilian 
temple). Since Shale will largely be hanging back with your archers to make 
the most of this build, you may want to focus less on Strength and more on 
Dexterity and Constitution for greater survivability.
<br><br>
Recommended crystal type: Lightning (for better dodging and ranged defense), 
Nature (to offset the tanking penalties), Spirit (for magic resistance)
<br><br>
Path 4: The Stone Aura Tree
<br><br>
Probably Shale's most unique talent set, Stone Aura basically turns Shale 
into an AoE buff/debuff statue. When it is active, Shale becomes immobile and 
suffers an enormous penalty to defense, but gains a number of survivability 
bonuses, grants huge bonuses to allies within the radius of the buff effect, 
and sizeable penalties to any enemies within its AoE. While her defense will 
drop to 0 or close to it, Shale gets a sizeable armour bonus and a boost to 
magic resistance, while allies get pretty much all of their combat statistics 
boosted, along with rapid health regeneration, making Shale an alternative to 
having a healing mage when in this mode. Though she is immobile, the buff 
radius is quite large when the talent tree is maxed out, and if Stone Aura is 
set to be used when enemies are at short range, Shale will usually activate 
it in an advantageous position. Alternately, you can micromanage her to 
choose where to set up the buff AoE. Since Shale cannot attack in this mode, 
you want only enough Strength to equip her highest grade of weapon crystals 
and then crank the rest of your points into Constitution (Dexterity will be 
of little help because of the steep defense penalty in this mode, and 
Willpower is of minimal use due to Shale's inability to use active talents in 
Stone Aura). Your goal is to be a wall of well-armoured, rapidly regenerating 
hit points, so that you can keep the buff up as long as possible even under 
enemy attacks. Though her armour is very high in this mode, Shale will still 
need protection because she is a sitting duck in this mode and, as you get 
further in the game, enemies tend to have a lot of ways to get around armour 
and still cause high damage.
<br><br>
Recommended crystal type: Nature (a must for the weapon crystal for the 
health regen bonus; large crystal provides nice armour bonuses), Spirit (for 
spell resistance)
<br><br>
Shale's Equipment
<br><br>
Shale's crystals have five grades rather than the typical seven which are, 
from worst to best: chipped, flawed, clear, flawless, brilliant. Any crystals 
of chipped or flawed grade only cause or protect from the corresponding 
elemental damage and have no other characteristics. However, from clear grade 
upward, each crystal type grants numerous bonuses to fit the roles they were
designed for. These are outlined below.
<br><br>
SMALL CRYSTALS
All small crystals convert Shale's damage to the corresponding elemental 
type, and provide a % damage bonus to that elemental type.
Stat to equip: Strength (38 for brilliant grade)
<br><br>
Fire: bonuses to % melee critical chance and % weapon damage.
Ice: bonuses to armour penetration and % critical/backstab damage.
Lightning: bonuses to Dexterity and attack.
Nature: bonuses to Constitution and health regeneration in combat.
Spirit: bonuses to all stats and armour penetration.
<br><br>
LARGE CRYSTALS
All large crystals provide a bonus to resistance against the corresponding
element.
Stat to equip: Constitution (38 for brilliant grade)
<br><br>
Fire: bonuses to Strength, defense, and stamina regeneration in combat.
Ice: bonuses to health regeneration, defense, and % healing effects received.
Lightning: bonuses to Dexterity, % chance to dodge attacks, and chance to 
avoid missile attacks.
Nature: bonuses to Constitution, armour, and physical resistance.
Spirit: bonuses to all stats, % spell resistance, and mental resistance.
<br><br>
Pros:
+ Extremely versatile in what roles she can fill in your party
+ Very sturdy and tough to kill in the early to mid game (less so in the late
game when dodging starts to matter more than hit points and armour)
+ Ability to pick and choose elemental damage types and resistances to fit 
the situation
+ Ability to easily customize stat bonuses by adaptively swapping gear
+ Can replace mage healers with the Stone Aura mode
+ Some of the best dialogue BioWare's ever written
+ Very low maintenance when it comes to approval
<br><br>
Cons:
- Lack of gear slots causes Shale to get a little bit overshadowed in the end
game
- Carrying around a good variety of crystals for Shale to use takes up a fair
bit of inventory space
- Many of Shale's modes come with significant drawbacks
- Small crystals do not have rune slots

<h4>5.9 - Oghren [DAOS5.9]</h4>

Race: Dwarf
Base Class: Warrior
Specialization: Berserker
Most Appropriate Build Archetype(s): Two-Hander
Best Default Tactic Set(s): Scrapper
Romance?: No
Bonus Stat: Constitution
Where to get him: Can be recruited during the A Paragon of Her Kind quest
Gift Hint: Oghren likes to hang out at Tapster's. You figure out the rest.
<br><br>
A disgraced member of the warrior caste, Oghren has turned increasingly to 
alcohol-soaked brooding since his wife and his house abandoned him to venture 
into the Deep Roads a few years beforehand. His main goal is to reunite with 
his wife and try to convince her to return to Orzammar with him, though he 
has never had the resources to carry out any such expedition. Oghren 
generally doesn't concern himself overly with right or wrong choices, or good 
and evil, preferring to solve most problems by drowning them in drink or 
flying into a berserk rage and introducing them to the business end of his 
weapon. Despite his downward spiral, he is still a formidable and talented 
warrior with valuable knowledge and insights.
<br><br>
Oghren, to an even greater degree than Sten because you get him later in the 
game, is kitted out to be a two-hander warrior. He starts with a solid 
selection of talents, and his specialization is a great compliment to his 
role. You'll mainly want to focus on Strength with Oghren, since he already 
starts with fairly high Constitution and will gain more as his approval 
rises. As a dwarf, he also comes with the ever-handy innate 10% chance to 
resist any hostile magic. That combined with the ability to have two 
specializations gives him an edge over Sten in this role. Champion is a great 
choice for a second specialization for Oghren, to allow him a little group 
buffing ability, and Reaver can work decently too for a little extra damage 
and self-healing.
<br><br>
Pros:
+ Starts with a solid two-hand warrior talent set
+ Full of personality with great dialogue
+ Dwarf, so you get 10% free spell resistance
+ Very low maintenance when it comes to his approval of your actions
<br><br>
Cons:
- Very little flexibility - you're basically stuck with two-handers unless
you want to nerf yourself
- Overlaps in niche with Sten
<br><br>

<h4>5.10 - Loghain [DAOS5.10]</h4>
<p>
Race: Human
Base Class: Warrior
Specialization: Champion
Most Appropriate Build Archetype(s): Tank
Best Default Tactic Set(s): Defender
Romance?: No
Bonus Stat: Constitution
Where to get him: allow him to go through a Joining after defeating him at 
the Landsmeet
Gift Hint: Loghain is a consummate military general and strategist, and what 
does every strategist need before the battle?
<br><br>
Loghain spends the vast majority of the game being your primary antagonist, 
doing whatever he can to make the last remaining Grey Wardens quite 
miserable. Though he is a military hero and a brilliant tactician, Loghain is 
somewhat out of his element in political circles, and makes many poor 
decisions, often at the urging of the corrupt Arl Howe. He is a warrior first 
and foremost, and is at his best when he can focus on battle to the exclusion 
of other more trifling matters. Loghain doesn't really approve of or object 
to anything, since there's not much game left by the time he's joined you. 
You'll have to gain approval primarily through gifts and a few limited 
dialogue options. Fundamentally, what's most important to Loghain is 
Ferelden's independence, especially from the Orlesians, which is no surprise 
given his background.
<br><br>
Loghain is fundamentally a shield tank, though he needs a fair bit of work to 
really get up to snuff in this role. Unfortunately, since you gain him so 
late in the game, you don't have much time to pull this off. Loghain suffers 
from a general under-abundance of Strength and, more importantly, Dexterity, 
and a bit of an overabundance of Willpower. Granted, this lets him use 
important talents such as Taunt more often, but it has unfortunately taken 
away vital stat points from Dexterity. Oh well, gotta work with what you 
have. Another major shortcoming to Loghain's talent set is that he may not 
have Shield Wall yet. This should absolutely be the first talent you grab 
whenever he levels up next if he does not have it. Do your best to mould him 
into the tank build in the time you have left before the final confrontation, 
and he'll serve decently enough. Good second specialization choices are 
Reaver for holding hostility and self-healing, or possibly Templar for some 
nice anti-mage abilities and gear options. 
<br><br>
Pros:
+ Starts with a decent set of armour
+ Relatively simple approval-wise
+ Can use full-powered Champion buffs right off the bat
<br><br>
Cons:
- Extremely low flexibility
- Have to lose Alistair to get him
- Starts with a suboptimal stat spread for a tank
- Missing a few key talents despite his high level
- Can be tricky to get his approval up to a high level before the end of the 
game
