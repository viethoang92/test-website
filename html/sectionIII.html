    <h3>Section III: Building The Warden</h3>
    <p>
        The first thing you need to do when building your character is to decide what kind of character you'd like them to be - what
        play style you prefer, what role you'd like them to fill, what you'd like them to be best at, etc. Below, I'll provide
        some guides for general character archetypes and how I'd approach building them. If you've played through the game
        before and are familiar with your possible companions, you may want to build your Warden to fit the same role as
        a companion you don't like so that you don't have to bring them along, or a role that complements a party of 3 companions
        you do like. Bear in mind that whatever role the Warden chooses, they will be the best at it. Because of the bonus
        stats, skills, and talents you can and do pick up throughout the game, you will end up being better built than any
        of your NPC companions are capable of being. For stat recommendations, I will specify whether the amount is the base
        amount (the amount shown when you're allocating stat points after leveling up) or the modified amount (the base amount
        plus all bonuses/penalties you are receiving from your specializations and equipped gear). When choosing skills,
        it should be noted that the Warden is the only character that may learn Coercion, and thus it's a good idea to put
        at least a point or two in here, as it will unlock a lot of very profitable options along the way. This is true for
        all builds, and is particularly easy to do as a rogue. It should also be noted that I strongly advocate taking both
        lockpicking/trap disarming and stealth skills on rogue Wardens. They're just plain too useful to pass up, even if
        it means having to delay other talent choices. You can have the lockpicking role covered by Leliana or Zevran if
        you wish, but there'll be a few locked chests where you won't have access to them and won't be able to open unless
        you can do it yourself. The exception to this is if your rogue happens to have very high Cunning modifiers, as they
        will not require as high a rank of lockpicking/disarming talents if they do. A quick summary of the roles covered
        and what they excel at: The Tank - combining spectacular dodging with huge armour absorption and 360 degree defense,
        the Tank maximizes the Warrior's survival potential while keeping their allies safe. The Two-Hander - the king (or
        queen) of spike damage, this build can shred bosses and crank out huge damage numbers but is more limited in drawn
        out combat. The Dual Wielder - unleashing a constant barrage of smaller but still potent blows, these melee fighters
        have unsurpassed sustained damage output and great potential for inflicting on-hit effects, such as runic boosts.
        The Archer - master of harassment from afar, you can inflict status effects, respectable damage, and a little crowd
        control from the safety of the rear. The Nuker - a mage focused on maximizing their pure destructive potential. Whole
        armies can be levelled by the spells you'll unleash. The Support Healer - even a tank can't do as much to keep their
        team alive as a good support mage. You are your team's best friend. The Debilitator - while not as spectacularly
        damaging as many other mages, the Debilitator can make any enemy cry with the sheer volume of debuff and crowd control
        spells available to magi. The Spellsword - built around the Arcane Warrior, this unusual mage becomes a walking wall
        of magic-infused melee damage absorption. Relatively low damage and greatly decreased spellcasting potential, but
        almost unsurpassed defensive might via sustained abilities. I'll provide a relative difficulty rating at the end
        of each role based on my experience playing them.

        <h4 id="tank">3.1 - The Tank [DAOS3.1] </h4>
        <p>
            The tank's whole purpose in life is to make enemies attack them rather than their companions and soak up as much damage as
            possible for as long as possible without dying. The two critical characteristics of a tank are maximized survivability
            through some combination of hit points, defense, armour, talents and healing sources, and management of monster
            hostility so that they can protect their allies. This role is a bit weak at first, as you have access to only
            weak armour, which won't change until you can boost your stats to meet prereqs and get to areas where you can
            acquire or purchase better gear. In addition, the stat you have to raise first is one that won't help your survivability
            much in and of itself, and you have to raise it a lot. Bear all this in mind. Base class: Warrior. You can also
            make a fair argument for Mage with the idea of going Arcane Warrior, but management of enemy hostility is far
            more difficult as a mage than it is as a warrior. Critical talents: Powerful - you will spend your whole life
            in the heaviest armour possible, and more hit points is never a bad thing. Threaten - one of the ways you make
            things attack you and not your allies. Essential. Taunt - to draw enemies onto yourself when Threaten isn't enough.
            Shield Wall - the lifeblood of your survivability. Get this ASAP and have it on at all times. Shield Tactics
            - immunity to flanking is a lifesaver in a number of tough fights. Shield Expertise - immunity to knockdown in
            Shield Wall mode is extremely useful. A tank that's on their ass isn't doing their job. Shield Mastery - this
            goes without saying, as it makes all your shield abilities better. Good talents: Bravery - you will spend most
            of your life being surrounded by lots of enemies. Might as well make the best of it. The Shield Bash Tree - all
            the attacks in this tree are useful when you can spare the talents, both for supplemental damage and for crowd
            control. Death Blow - might as well get some stamina for killing things once you can spare the talents. Shield
            Defense - good to use until you get Shield Wall; if you rely more on dodging than armour, you may want to continue
            using this. Precise Striking - the critical hit bonus can be useful if you get hit with an inopportune Misdirection
            Hex. Depending on your preferences, you may wish to have this on all the time. Specializations: Champion - a
            great choice if you want to support your party. The bonus to defense will also help out your tanking, and War
            Cry can aid your survivability and crowd control. Templar - Cleanse Area is always useful, but probably the best
            thing about this specialization is some of the gear it unlocks. A favourite for tanks. Reaver - useful for the
            corpse eating heal (particularly if you have no mage healer) and the boost to Threaten and Taunt. The last two
            abilities probably shouldn't be used. Berserker - probably the least useful specialization for a tank. Doing
            damage isn't really your job. General stat spread: Strength: 42 modified Dexterity: as high as possible Willpower:
            20-30ish modified depending on how much you like using active talents Magic: 20ish modified Cunning: 16 base
            Constitution: 30ish modified The general idea with tank stats is that you want to focus on Strength first, so
            that you can start wearing heavier armours as soon as possible. If you have the Blood Dragon Armour DLC, then
            this can allow you to get into a very nice set of armour quite early on in the game, which will do wonders for
            your durability. While investing in Dexterity or Constitution early on would do more to keep you alive during
            the first few levels, it's a worse option in the end. A lot of the other stat recommendations I listed can be
            fulfilled simply by doing the Broken Circle quest and getting all the permanent stat bonuses there. Willpower
            and Magic are really totally up to you, depending on how much you use stamina and how important you think it
            is to get more or less healing from poultices. Cunning should be 16 base so that you can max out any skill you
            want, like Coercion; anything above that is up to you. Constitution is also largely up to personal taste; some
            people like to put a lot of CON onto tanks, but in general, it's not as helpful as you might think. Each point
            of CON only gives you a 5 hp boost, which is pretty paltry and generally only delaying the inevitable in a tough
            fight. By contrast, high Dexterity can turn your tank into an unholy walking wall. Great dodging ability from
            a combination of Dexterity and boosts from your sustained shield abilities will mean that on top of your spectacularly
            high armour absorption value, you're also difficult to hit. When I've played around with stacking DEX versus
            stacking CON, I've found DEX does a lot more to keep my tank alive than CON does. You can actually achieve very
            high defense values with a DEX- stacked shieldtank. Difficulty rating: Early game - Hard Mid game - Average to
            easy Late game - Very easy
        </p>
        <h4 id="twoHander">3.2 - The Two-Hander</h4>

        Two-Hander builds tend to be designed to do as much single-hit melee damage as possible, while having enough survivability
        to live to tell about it afterward. On top of having great damage output, you can make use of heavy armours and gain
        yourself a respectable hit point pool to keep you going after a hard knock or two. The Two-Hander also excels at
        inflicting debuffs on tough single targets, like bosses, while being highly resistant to status effects yourself.
        Add in a little crowd control and AoE capability into the mix, and you have a melee force to be reckoned with. You
        will be focusing a fair bit on your activated talents, as spike damage is truly where this build excels. Because
        of your painfully long swing time, you really don't want to rely on autoattacks any more than you absolutely have
        to; stamina management to keep dishing out active talents is key in this build. Base Class: Warrior. The other two
        don't make sense because you can't learn any two-handed talents. Critical talents: Powerful - armour and hit points
        will be your major way of living through battles. Sunder Arms - on top of debuffing attack, this is actually one
        of your best DPS skills, as it hits twice, doesn't cost much stamina, and has a relatively short cooldown. It'll
        regularly do more damage than Mighty Blow and will be ready again sooner. And you can get it nice and early due to
        its low placement in its talent tree. Sunder Armour - a more useful debuff than Sunder Arms and about the same damage
        output, but with a longer cooldown, a higher stamina cost, and more prerequisites. Still a must-have. Bravery - you'll
        be in the thick of it very often, and damage bonuses are always welcome in this build. Death Blow - with your huge
        hits, you'll get killing blows pretty often. Gaining stamina for each one will help power your active talents. Indomitable
        - damage bonus and knockdown/stun immunity? Score. Sign me up. I'd use this for the stun immunity alone, particularly
        later in the game when you get swarmed by scattershotting archer hordes. Stunning Blows - once you have this talent,
        every critical hit you land will have quite a good chance of also stunning your opponent. A great passive. Mighty
        Blow - your bread-and-butter DPS skill for the early levels, and still useful later on. Destroyer - basically a passive
        Sunder Armour with every attack. Why the hell not? Two-Handed Sweep - probably the best melee AoE in the game. It's
        360 degrees, like Whirlwind, but seems to do slightly better damage and has a powerful knockdown. Good talents: Pommel
        Strike - being able to knock an annoying baddie on their ass is always handy. Unfortunately, you can usually only
        get one swing in before they're up on their feet again. However, its low cost and how early you can learn it make
        it handy, particularly for disrupting spellcasting. Precise Striking - good to pair up with Powerful Swings or Indomitable,
        particularly in the early levels when your attack bonus isn't that high yet - after all, a miss hurts a lot for a
        two-hander because of how long your recovery is. You'll barely notice the decrease in speed, since it's absolute
        rather than relative, and you'll get a nice crit bonus too, which works particularly well with the Stunning Blows
        passive. Powerful Swings - good for mowing through grunt-level enemies. Since it can be used at the same time as
        Indomitable, it's good to have it on once you get Two-Handed Strength to reduce the penalties. Critical Strike -
        another good spike DPS skill, much like Mighty Blow but with a slightly different effect. Get it eventually, but
        it's not a priority. Disengage - to lose enemy hostility in a pinch. Definitely not a priority, but it can come in
        handy. Specializations: Berserker: Yes, yes, and more yes. This specialization is all about improving your damage,
        and that's what you do. This is pretty much a no-brainer. Reaver: This specialization can work out okay. Corpse eating
        to heal is good in a pinch, and if you do happen to lose some hit points, you may as well get a damage bonus for
        your trouble. Be careful with the AoE DoT, because that can take hostility away from your tank and stick it onto
        you, which is bad news. Champion: Not a bad choice, as more Willpower means more stamina, War Cry can be good for
        giving yourself a bit of breathing space if you get surrounded, and buffing your group is rarely a bad thing. Templar:
        Cleanse Area never hurts, but you'll already be getting a mental resistance boost from Berserk and you attack so
        slowly that the mana drain thing will have minimal impact. I'd only take it if you want to wear templar gear. General
        stat spread: Strength: this should be where most of your stat points go Dexterity: 18 base Willpower: 25-40 modified
        depending on your style and what gear you have Magic: irrelevant Cunning: 16 base Constitution: put whatever points
        aren't going into Strength or Willpower here The idea with this stat spread is that you should be doing damage rather
        than taking it. High Strength from the early game onward means access to great gear and more damage output, as well
        as a high attack rating. It's hard to go wrong with Strength in this build. Dexterity is just high enough to get
        Disengage; if you don't want Disengage, it can be lower. You could try making a two-hander that uses dodging for
        a bit of emergency defense, but I haven't found that to work very well so far. I like to use high Constitution instead,
        since two-handers can't benefit from the defensive bonuses that shieldtanks get, so even with fairly high Dexterity,
        they still won't be very good at dodging. For the times that you take damage, you'll generally be better off relying
        on armour absorption and a decent hit point pool. Strength is definitely a higher priority than Constitution though,
        as each point of Strength will give you more benefit in general. Magic's only effect is to make poultices heal you
        for more, and you shouldn't be taking damage all that often if your tank is doing their job. Cunning to base 16 for
        skills. The end goal is to create a character that can hit like a mack truck and can survive a beating long enough
        for your group's tank to get enemies under control. Alternately, you can forgo Constitution and focus on stacking
        Strength for some hideously high damage output, but it's a riskier path and requires that you put a lot of faith
        in your tank's ability to control hostility. Make sure that between gear and Willpower that you have a decent stamina
        pool, as this build really only shines when you are unleashing chains of Sunder Arms/Armour, Mighty Blow, Critical
        Strike, and Two-Handed Sweep. I like to get my base Willpower somewhere around 20 and supplement with nice Willpower
        or stamina-boosting gear, then build 2 Strength 1 Constitution per level until I have a comfortable pool of hit points
        into the 300s or so. After that, it's pretty safe (and very effective) to just pile on the Strength. Difficulty rating:
        Early game - Average Mid game - Easy Late game - Easy
    </div>
    <div class="rogue">
        <h4 id="dualWielder">3.3 - The Dual Wielder [DAOS3.3]</h4>

        This will actually be two different guides, as you can do this effectively as either a rogue or a warrior. The role of the
        dual wielder is to crush enemies with many lightning fast attacks as opposed to single large hits. The focus will
        be more on finesse, incapacitation and the element of surprise than brute frontal power. Dual wielders can get maximal
        effectiveness out of runes that activate on a per-hit basis, like damage and paralysis runes. When built correctly,
        dual wielders have the highest sustained melee damage output of any character type. 3.3a - The Rogue Dual Wielder
        I feel that this is a more well-rounded dual wield build than the warrior variant, though both are very strong in
        their own ways. Rogues can take this build to a truly frightening level due to how well their class mechanics and
        specializations synergize with the dual wielding style. Base Class: Rogue, obviously. Critical talents: Momentum
        - this should always be the talent you work toward in dual wielding builds. It is the backbone of the entire build
        and one of the most powerful sustained abilities in the game. The only time you shouldn't prioritize this is if you're
        planning on having Haste up all the time, because the two do not stack. Dirty Fighting - probably the very first
        talent you learned, and one of the best single target stuns in the game. Useful right off the bat, and extremely
        useful once you pair it up with Coup de Grace. Combat Movement - makes it far easier to flank enemies. Coup de Grace
        - automatic backstabs on stunned/paralyzed enemies? Very yes. Lethality - your Cunning will almost certainly end
        up higher than your Strength, and +10% critical hit chance is nothing to sneeze at. Combat Stealth - the ultimate
        in losing hostility and repositioning for more backstabbing. Stealth also makes you a terrific mage neutralizer.
        The Dual-Weapon Training tree - the better you are at dual wielding, the more likely you are to land hits. Always
        a good thing. Get the first two in the tree sooner rather than later. Riposte - another stun for your arsenal; a
        perfect trifecta with Dirty Fighting and Coup de Grace. Punisher - lets you work in some excellent spike damage with
        your sustained DPS output. Good talents: Cripple - a solid single target debuff, good for bosskilling. Flurry - useful
        when an enemy can't be backstabbed. Not as good as Punisher, but it costs a bit less and you can get it earlier.
        Dual-Weapon Sweep - a quick, cheap attack to boost your AoE damage. Specializations: Duelist: An excellent choice.
        Keen Defense will give a nice boost to your survivability, and Pinpoint Strike will let you shred even backstab-immune
        targets with ease. Assassin: Another excellent choice. The various boosts to your damage will all let you do your
        job better. Bard: Not a bad choice if you want to support your group while also fighting, but not nearly as complimentary
        as Duelist or Assassin. Ranger: The powers of this specialization generally won't help you all that much. Not useless,
        but not a great synergy either. General stat spread: Strength: 20 modified (22 if you want to use Cadash Stompers)
        Dexterity: as high as you can get it Willpower: pure personal preference Magic: irrelevant Cunning: at least 30 modified
        Constitution: irrelevant Since patch 1.02, I feel that there's only one good way to go with the dual wielding rogue:
        a pair of good daggers and as much DEX as you can humanly cram onto yourself. With Lethality, the only thing you
        need Strength for is equipping items. You can wear any drakeskin leather armour with 20 Strength, so that's where
        you should cut it off. Willpower will depend entirely on how much you like using activated talents - this build can
        work fine either skillspamming or almost purely relying on autoattacks from Momentum. Magic only boosts your poultice
        healing, which shouldn't really be necessary, and you shouldn't be getting damaged enough to warrant boosting Constitution.
        You'll likely want 30 modified Cunning so that you can disarm any trap and pick any lock in the game, as well as
        giving you a boost to other relevant skills like Coercion and Stealing. Cunning will also help your armour penetration,
        though that'll already be pretty good thanks to dagger stats, and with Lethality it'll also give you a general damage
        boost. If you chose Bard as one of your specializations, you may wish to raise Cunning higher to boost your buff
        strength. With Dexterity as your stat focus and a good set of gear, you'll find that both your damage output and
        your dodge tanking ability will both be extremely high, making all but the toughest fights a breeze to waltz through.
        This build is easily one of the most potent in the game. Pop into stealth, disarm any traps waiting for you, and
        walk behind the target you want to neutralize first (mages are always a good choice). Move your party's tank into
        view, pop out of stealth, stun your target and watch the backstabs fly. Difficulty rating: Early game - Average Mid
        game - Average to easy Late game - Very easy 3.3b - The Warrior Duel Wielder This build is similar to the rogue version,
        but will have some noticeable differences. Because you do not have backstabs to supplement your damage, you will
        be focusing more on head on combat and making your normal strikes as effective as possible. Also as a result of losing
        backstabs (and, by extension, losing extremely high damage output from well-placed autoattacks), you will be more
        focused on active skill use in this build than in the rogue build, making Willpower proportionally more important.
        Having high Strength and two full-sized weapons will go a long way toward making up the backstab damage deficit,
        and being able to use heavier armour without incurring as much fatigue helps to offset having less dodging than your
        rogue counterparts. Base Class: Warrior, obviously. Critical talents: Momentum - while this is somewhat less awesome
        without backstabbage, it's still a cornerstone of any dual wield build. Get ASAP, unless you're planning on using
        Haste all the time. Powerful - there's really no warrior builds where this isn't a useful talent. Less fatigue and
        more hit points all from an early talent is bitchin'. The Dual Weapon talent tree - as a warrior dual wielder, you'll
        probably want to get the entire thing sooner rather than later. Riposte - your only stun, and stuns are always useful.
        Cripple - a nice debuff for taking down tough single enemies, like bosses. Punisher - a warrior dual wielder should
        be able to put out a huge amount of damage with this attack; easily one of the best spike damage talents in the game,
        and a must-have for this build. Bravery - you'll spend a fair bit of your time in the thick of it, and Bravery will
        make you stronger when you are. Death Blow - since you'll be using a lot of active talents, gaining stamina back
        for killing blows will help you keep it up. Dual Weapon Sweep - considering its low cost, short cooldown, and how
        early you can get it, this is a surprisingly good talent for a little bit of frontal arc AoE spike damage. Good talents:
        Precise Striking - this can be a good ability to throw on if you're aiming to improve your autoattacks by boosting
        your critical hit rate. It's also good for counteracting a pesky Misdirection Hex, which enemy mages love casting
        on you. Note that it drops autoattack speed, though. Dual Striking - the opposite of Precise Striking, this is a
        good sustained to activate early on in the game, since you can't backstab and your critical hit rate will be low
        even if you're using daggers. Disengage - if you end up catching more hostility than you'd like, use this to turn
        their attention back to the tank where it belongs. Flurry - basic multi-hit activated damage talent. Whirlwind -
        I find this talent more useful on warrior dual wielders than their rogue equivalent. Still, considering it's an end
        tree talent, I find the cost- to-damage ratio a bit on the chintzy side. At the very least, you can chip away at
        that achievement. Specializations: Berserker - most likely the best choice for this build, as it gives you that lovely
        damage bonus. The dual wielding style of many smaller hits is actually a pretty good compliment to Berserk's absolute
        (as opposed to relative) damage bonus, which makes you an utter wrecking ball in the early game and still a great
        performer later. Access to this specialization is one of the reasons to play warrior rather than rogue in a dual
        wielder build. Templar - an interesting choice for this build, since you will probably have decent Willpower, and
        the rapidity of your strikes means you may actually notice the mana-draining effect. Champion - since you'll have
        to have at least decent Dexterity for this build in order to get all the dual wielding talents, the Champion's combination
        of War Cry and Rally may aid your survivability some. Just watch that you don't pull a bunch of hostility by using
        AoE effects. Reaver - probably the least suited specialization to this build. About the only terribly useful thing
        would be the corpse eating, but you shouldn't be getting hit a lot if your tank is doing their job. General Stat
        Spread: Strength - see below Dexterity - at least base 36 Willpower - you'll probably want at least 30 modified or
        equivalent +stamina gear Magic - irrelevant Cunning - base 16 Constitution - see below The dual wielding warrior
        is one of the setups that allows for a large number of potential build possibilities, all of which have associated
        plusses and minuses. It's hard to say which is the 'best' build, since the warrior setup doesn't really lend itself
        to any particular stat loadout. What's generally consistent between these builds is having at least 36 Dexterity
        to max out the Dual Wielding talents, a fairly high Willpower to be able to use active skills often while running
        a couple sustained abilities, and the standard 16 Cunning for learning skills. Variant 1: DEX stacking This variant
        is built pretty similarly to the rogue dual wielder. Get as much Strength as you need to wear the armour you want
        (probably only need 20 modified or so, since most of the best bonuses for this style of fighting come from light
        armour anyway), don't bother raising Constitution much (if at all), and crank Dexterity as high as you can. You would
        use dual daggers for this build, meaning that maxing out the Dual Wielding proficiency tree is a relatively low priority.
        You'll never be able to achieve the dodge defense of a rogue, but you'll be a little sturdier and will suffer from
        a bit less fatigue. This used to be a poor option, but with the dagger fix in patch 1.02, it has become quite viable.
        Variant 2: STR stacking This variant is built around getting to Dual-Weapon Mastery sooner rather than later so that
        you can use two normal-size weapons at the same time. With this build, you'll cap your Dexterity at base 36, add
        just enough Constitution that you feel comfortable surviving (probably not much higher than 20 base), and pump all
        the rest into Strength to massively boost your damage output. With this build, you can have some pretty devastating
        weapon combinations, such as Starfang in one hand and the Keening Blade (or perhaps a Vanguard, Bloodline, or even
        better, a Veshialle if you want a non-sword) in the other. This is probably the most death-prone of the variants,
        since both your hit points and dodging ability will be low, but you'll be able to wear excellent armour, and your
        tank should be taking most of the hits anyway. For killing things frighteningly quickly, this is likely the best
        variant, and my personal favourite, give or take a couple CON points. Variant 3: STR/CON balancing This variant is
        fairly similar to the two-handed build suggested earlier, balancing damage output from Strength with some survivability
        gained through Constitution. While you shouldn't be taking hits that often, it's inevitable that your tank will have
        a few enemies slip free of their hostility control, and even a tank that's doing their job can't necessarily save
        you from big spell AoEs and the like. This build will never have the damage output of a Strength stacker, but will
        have far more margin of error if things go poorly or you encounter some nasty surprises. You'll still want to put
        the majority of your points into Strength, but the proportion will be largely up to your personal tastes; a general
        template might be to go 2:1 STR:CON. Difficulty rating: Early game - Hard to average Mid game - Average Late game
        - Easy

        <h4 id="archer">3.4 - The Archer [DAOS3.4] </h4>
        Again, this will be two different builds as you can be an archer as both a warrior and a rogue; your choice of base class
        will have a significant impact on how this fighting style performs. The archer's role is to hang back from the front
        lines and pick targets of opportunity to incapacitate and slay one at a time (though they do get a rather nasty AoE
        ability, but only one, so you're hardly going to be an AoE powerhouse the way a mage can be). Archers make great
        mage killers and group supporters, and pack a good punch against bosses, but can get swamped if they get surrounded
        by lots of foes, so make sure your tank's doing their job. Long charge times on most of their powers means that,
        like mages, archers are at their best when they have some breathing room. 3.4a - The Rogue Archer In general, I feel
        that rogues are the better base class for archers, since their specializations offer better synergy. They might be
        slightly inferior if you're planning on using crossbows, though. Base Class: Rogue, obviously. Critical talents:
        Melee Archer - at some point, you're going to get hit with melee attacks while trying to shoot. Getting disrupted
        constantly gets old fast. Critical Shot - great single shot damage. Arrow of Slaying - this is essentially instant
        death to the target of your choice. It outdamages any other weapon talent in the game by a country mile. Get ASAP.
        Nabbing the 'Heavy Hitter' achievement is laughably easy with this talent. Rapid Shot - this is a great sustained
        ability for the early game, when you don't have access to bows with the Rapid Aim property. Scattershot - Your one
        AoE, and it's a beauty, too. One of the best crowd control attacks in the game. Master Archer - makes all your archery
        talents better, and lets you wear heavy armour without any archery drawbacks. What's not to like? Good talents: Dirty
        Fighting - good for getting some breathing space when a pesky enemy manages to get into melee range. Lethality -
        you'll probably have more Cunning than Strength as a rogue, so you may as well capitalize on it. Too bad the critical
        hit bonus only affects melee. You can ignore this talent if you're planning on using crossbows. Aim - a decent sustained
        mode for enemies with very high defense, or for when you're under the effects of a Misdirection Hex. Suppressing
        Fire - a sustained mode that makes every shot debuff enemy attack scores, and it stacks, too. Can be paired up with
        other sustained archery abilities, like Rapid Shot. Pinning Shot - good for keeping an enemy at range when you get
        the jump on them. Crippling Shot - a handy debuff for boss fights. Defensive Fire - you may wish to toss this on
        if your tank loses hostility and you find yourself in hot water. Specializations: Bard - one of the best specializations
        to pair up with archery, especially if your goal is to be a supporter for the rest of your team. The bard song buffs
        affect your whole party even if they're not near you. The stat bonuses are useful as well. Duelist - another great
        specialization for archers. While two of the four talents are largely useless, the benefits of the Dueling sustained
        are very helpful. Ranger - this specialization pairs up better with archers than dual wielders, as it provides another
        party member to distract things and keep them out of your hair. Assassin - probably the least useful specialization
        for an archer, as you won't be inflicting backstabs. The Dexterity bonus is quite nice, but aside from that, it's
        not a good pairing. General stat spread: Strength - 20 modified (or whatever your gear of choice demands for prereqs)
        Dexterity - generally very high; see below Willpower - 20 modified or more Magic - irrelevant Cunning - moderate
        to high; see below Constitution - irrelevant There's generally two ways that I feel would be effective in building
        a rogue archer, though your actual preference may fall somewhere a bit outside or between these two. The common elements
        of both are only getting enough modified Strength to satisfy equipment requirements - this will be higher if you
        want to use heavier armour or high tier crossbows. Willpower shouldn't be too low, since you'll want to have a sustained
        ability or two running but still be able to make good use of all your active talents, which tend to be quite costly.
        The various bonuses you get to Constitution as you go through the game should be enough to give you a decent pool
        of hit points, so I wouldn't recommend raising it much, if at all. The main differences between the two variants
        will be how you distribute your stat points between Dexterity and Cunning. Variant 1: DEX stacking This build raises
        Cunning enough to make your rogue skills perform at a high enough level to get you through the game (30 modified),
        and puts the rest of your remaining points into Dexterity. The benefits of this are that you will get both good damage
        and good accuracy out of any ranged weapon you choose. It's particularly valuable to crossbow rogues, as Cunning
        will have no effect on their damage. DEX stacking also has the added value of giving you great dodging ability, meaning
        that you can tank quite well in a pinch. Variant 2: DEX/CUN balancing This build is oriented toward longbow and shortbow
        rogues, particularly those who wish to get the most out of the Bard specialization. In this build, you will still
        have a lot of Dexterity, but you will also want to invest a fair bit in your Cunning stat, getting it to modified
        values of 50 or more. While this will cost you in terms of accuracy and your dodging ability, you won't lose any
        damage, and will in fact do better damage against heavily armoured targets due to the bonus to armour penetration
        from high Cunning scores. You will also be an outstanding skill user even if you don't get the maximum rank for those
        skills, which can allow you to get a greater breadth of skills or save a talent on lockpicking. Because of your lowered
        dodging ability, you may wish to invest a bit more in Constitution than a DEX stacker would, or possibly wear medium
        or heavy armour rather than light armour. This build will generally have lower solo performance than the Dexterity-stacked
        variant, but will make a better group supporter. Difficulty rating: Early game - Very hard Mid game - Hard to average
        Late game - Average to easy 3.4b - The Warrior Archer A relatively uncommon build for the Warden, but a viable one
        nonetheless. The downside is that the warrior specializations tend to do very little to compliment ranged fighting
        styles. However, warriors do gain the benefit of having more hit points, stamina, and base attack bonus than rogues,
        and most importantly, gain a bonus to fatigue due to their talents, which can be a surprisingly large asset when
        using the archer's costly attacks. Base Class: Warrior, obviously. Critical talents: Powerful - again, this is pretty
        much a no-brainer for any warrior, and the fatigue bonus is particularly useful to archers. Melee Archer - getting
        disrupted by melee attacks is never a good thing. Get ASAP. Death Blow - I'm not actually positive whether or not
        this works for ranged attacks. If it does, it'll be quite helpful. If not, disregard it. Critical Shot - a great
        damage talent. Arrow of Slaying - your one hit wonder power; instant death to the majority of enemies you'll come
        across. Get ASAP. Totally worth the long cooldown, high cost, and stamina regen penalty. Scattershot - crowd control
        at its finest. Master Archer - makes what's good even better. Should be a relatively high priority. Rapid Shot -
        a good sustained mode, particularly for the early levels when you won't have much of a critical hit rate anyway.
        Good talents: Precise Striking - a passive mode that does pretty much the same thing as Aim, but unlike Aim, it can
        be active at the same time as Rapid Shot. Can be good to throw on against enemies with high evasion. Disengage -
        for getting out of tight spots when your tank loses hostility. Perfect Striking - archery tends not to be as accurate
        as melee; this talent can help to offset this against tough enemies. Aim - generally lower damage output than Rapid
        Shot, but can be preferable against high evasion targets or if a Misdirection Hex is thrown on you. Note that it
        does not actually boost your critical hit rate, as crit boosts for ranged seem to be largely nonexistent except on
        a couple pieces of gear. However, Rapid Shot drops your critical hit rate to 0, so Aim can be preferable nonetheless.
        Pinning Shot - good for keeping a tougher enemy at bay. Crippling Shot - a nice boss debuffer. Shattering Shot -
        a decent single target debuff/crowd control combo of armour penalty and possible knockdown. Suppressing Fire - a
        good sustained to pair up with Rapid Shot, as it inflicts a stacking debuff to attack bonus with every hit. Specializations:
        Champion - while not as well suited to archers as the Bard specialization, Champion is still definitely one of the
        better choices as you'll be able to buff nearby allies and give yourself some room to breathe if you get surrounded
        by using a Superiority-boosted War Cry. Templar - Most of the talents are melee-based and thus kind of useless, but
        the mental resistance boost can be handy. Berserker - mostly useless, as the best bonuses occur only when you're
        using melee attacks. However, if you really want a health regeneration boost or some bonus Strength and hit points,
        take this specialization. Reaver - probably the worst choice, as the bonuses are pretty weak and the talents are
        almost completely useless to a ranged fighter. General stat spread: Strength - between 20 and 38 modified, depending
        on desired gear prereqs Dexterity - where most of your stat points should end up Willpower - 20 modified or more
        Magic - irrelevant Cunning - 16 base Constitution - irrelevant The idea with this spread is to have enough Willpower
        to allow you to use active attacks regularly, enough Strength to wear all the gear you want, enough Cunning to max
        out whatever skills you desire, and the rest put into Dexterity. Between the base hit point growth of warriors, the
        bonus from Powerful, and any Constitution bonuses you gain throughout the game, you'll have more than enough hit
        points to function well as an archer, and you shouldn't have to be relying heavily on poultice healing. The biggest
        variable here will be the kind of gear you want to use. Shortbows, longbows, and light armour will have minimal Strength
        demands, while heavy dragonbone armour and crossbows will have high demands. There's not really much point in Strength
        stacking even if you use longbows, since you gain just as much damage from Dexterity plus increases in accuracy and
        dodging. Wearing massive armour is a bad idea because it penalizes your archery. Difficulty rating: Early game -
        Very hard Mid game - Hard Late game - Hard to average

        <h4 id="preface">3.5 - A Preface on Mage Builds [DAOS3.5] </h4>
        This will be a more complicated section, as mages function quite differently from rogues and warriors in general. As the
        latter classes, it generally pays to pick one combat style and stick with it, whether it be dual wielding, two- handed
        weaponry, weapon-and-shield, or archery. Dabbling in other weapon trees usually yields very little benefit to your
        character, if any. However, with mages, they are equally viable when drawing heavily from a single school of magic,
        or dabbling a little in all of them. This means that a mage can pack more variety and versatility into a single character
        build than warriors or rogues can. I will be laying out fairly specialized roles for mage characters to fill, but
        in all likelihood any mage Warden you make will be a blend of these roles for the sake of versatility. In addition,
        the Arcane Warrior specialization is so distinctly different from any other build in the game that it will get its
        own little section at the end. Some spells are useful to a wide variety of mage roles and builds. I'll list them
        below. Staff Focus - adds a boost to your autoattack damage with staves. Nothing to prioritize, but it adds up over
        time. Arcane Mastery - a bonus 5 spellpower. Definitely not a priority, and unfortunately at the end of a feat tree,
        but if you have spare feats, it can't hurt. Heal - right at the start of a tree so you can get it without any prereqs.
        It's almost never a bad idea to have some kind of heal. Heroic Aura - one of the few banes of your existence as a
        mage is archers, and this helps counter the threat they pose. Glyph of Repulsion - a fantastic ability for warding
        off pesky melee types that cramp your style. You can giggle to yourself as they futilely bounce around trying to
        get to you. Death Syphon - arguably the most broadly useful mage sustained ability, Death Syphon lets you suck the
        energy out of corpses to replenish your mana. Mind Blast - A fast casting AoE stun with no prereqs. Can be a real
        lifesaver, particularly early in the game. Rock Armour - a sustained you can toss on to give yourself an instant
        and sizeable armour boost. Never hurts to have this around as an option.

        <h4 id="nuker">3.6 - The Nuker [DAOS3.6] </h4>

        This role specializes in a scorched-earth approach to combat, filling the role typically associated with invoker-type mages
        in other games. The focus will be on both leveling whole armies of normal enemies with devastation area of effect
        spells, and being able to fry single tough enemies like bosses with equal ease. You will be a bit of a 'glass cannon',
        but it won't matter because things will usually die before they can do much damage to you anyway. The sheer carnage
        this role can wreak on the battlefield is unmatchable by any other. Base class: Mage Recommended Spells: Tempest
        - a nice electrical AoE that damages and drains the mana/stamina of anyone in its radius for a while. Half of the
        Storm of the Century combo (more on combos at the end of the mage builds). Blizzard - a nice ice element AoE that
        does damage and can freeze anyone in its radius. The other half of the Storm of the Century combo. Fireball - a quick
        casting, potent fire AoE that knocks back and inflicts a DoT on everything it hits. Earthquake - a large earth AoE
        that damages and can knock down anything in its radius for its duration. Spell Might - for when you want to rapidly
        overwhelm enemies with fewer spells. A great fit for the Nuker role. Virulent Walking Bomb - stick a DoT on an enemy
        in the middle of a group, and when they die, they explode, inflicting huge damage on everything around them. Crushing
        Prison - one of the best single target abilities in the game, this paralyzes and inflicts a powerful DoT that will
        be a death sentence to all but the strongest of enemies. Chain Lightning - a forking lightning spell that's good
        for inflicting a lot of damage quickly to a large group of enemies, as well as rapidly draining their mana and stamina
        reserves. Stinging Swarm - a potent Nature spell that damages one enemy at a time until they die, hopping from foe
        to foe for its duration. Mana Clash - the magenuke; turns an enemy spellcaster's mana against them, using it to fuel
        the damage caused by this spell. This is guaranteed death for the overwhelming majority of mage enemies in the game.
        Almost feels like cheating, since the enemy never turns the tables by using it on your mages. Death Cloud - a large
        AoE that inflicts Spirit damage with each pulse for its duration. Specializations: Blood Mage - the perfect fit for
        this build. The Blood Mage's abilities are a great compliment to the Nuker's play style. Spirit Healer - a good choice,
        with nice stat bonuses and the ability to give your group a boost when the need arises. Shapeshifter - not a good
        choice, as you sacrifice all of your AoE devastation by changing forms. Arcane Warrior - though the protective bonuses
        from Shimmering Shield can be nice in a pinch, you generally won't want to suffer the fatigue and mana drain that
        comes along with these abilities. General stat spread: Strength - as low as possible Dexterity - as low as possible
        Willpower - low to moderate, depending on how much you use Blood Magic Magic - where the majority of your points
        should be going; very high Cunning - 16 base Constitution - low to moderate, depending on how large a 'pool' you
        like to have while using Blood Magic Strength is useless to almost every mage build. Dexterity won't help this build
        much either, since you aren't meant to survive in melee combat - you should be avoiding it either by hanging back
        while your tank does their job, and/or by slaughtering everything before it can get near you. Willpower will depend
        on how much casting you want to be able to do outside of Blood Magic, so this is a matter of personal preference.
        Higher Willpower is necessary to keep up lots of casting if you are not a Blood Mage or only use Blood Magic occasionally.
        Cunning should be base 16 for skill use, as it serves little other purpose for this build. Constitution is generally
        not a priority as you shouldn't be taking much damage, but it increases your mana pool and gives you more of a cushion
        for mishaps while using Blood Magic or facing off against lots of archers. The main stat focus of this build is Magic,
        which should be stacked very high for maximum effectiveness. This has the added benefit of making both health poultices
        (outside of Blood Magic) and lyrium potions extremely effective. A nuker with a high Magic stat should have no trouble
        laying waste to whole platoons of enemies. Difficulty rating: Early game - Very easy Mid game - Very easy Late game
        - Easy

        <h4 id="supportHealer">3.7: The Support Healer [DAOS3.7]</h4>
        In direct contrast to the Nuker, this role focuses on making your allies stronger and keeping them in the fight for as long
        as possible. For the most part, you won't have much spare time or mana to be casting offensive spells, instead devoting
        them to healing and buffing effects designed to maximize the performance of your entire group. This is probably the
        easiest mage role to stick on AI autopilot, as healing can be achieved relatively effectively with a good tactics
        slot setup. Base Class: Mage Recommended Spells: Weapon enchantment spells, e.g. Flame Weapon - getting one of these
        buffs can be quite helpful to your group, as it will add additional damage to melee attacks at a relatively low cost
        to you. Heal - a useful spell for any mage, as mentioned above, but absolutely critical to this build. Get this as
        one of your first spell selections. Rejuvenate - good for keeping a heavy skill using party member going for longer.
        Use wisely, as it has a long cooldown. Regeneration - paired up with Heal, this spell can keep your tank alive through
        all but the toughest encounters. Mass Rejuvenation - a useful spell in long battles, when your whole party is depleted
        of stamina or mana. Heroic Offense - use this when up against enemies with high evasion, or to give a boost to a
        character suffering from low attack bonuses, like an Arcane Warrior. Heroic Defense - use this on an ally with weaker
        defense in tough fights. Haste - boost up the attack speed of archers and melee allies (though don't bother with
        Momentum-boosted dual wielders). Be cautious, as it penalizes your mana regeneration while it's in effect. Glyph
        of Warding - a stationary AoE that buffs the defense, mental resistance and missile avoidance of allies within its
        effect. Anti-Magic Ward - protect an ally from harmful enemy spells. Force Field - can be good as a last minute keep-alive
        measure for a critically injured party member. Arcane Shield - definitely not a priority, but if you decide to invest
        a bit in Dexterity and/or are using a lot of mage equipment that boosts your defense and dodging ability, you may
        wish to stick this on as an additional survival measure. Specializations: Spirit Healer - the ideal specialization
        for this role, as it adds group healing capabilities, helpful bonuses, the ability to remove injuries without kits,
        and battlefield resurrection to your bag of tricks. Blood Mage - grants nice bonuses, but using any of the Blood
        Mage's abilities as a support healer requires care and caution. Generally not necessary to fulfill your role effectively.
        Arcane Warrior - you generally won't want to use the full abilities of this specialization, as the fatigue penalties
        incurred will prevent you from healing effectively. However, staying alive is key to keeping the rest of your party
        alive, and being able to throw on Shimmering Shield in a tough situation can be nice. Shapeshifter - none of the
        forms give any benefit to this role, making it a very poor choice. The only reason to take it is for the armour bonus.
        General stat spread: Strength - as low as possible Dexterity - generally low Willpower - high Magic - high Cunning
        - 16 base Constitution - low (15-20 modified is plenty) Again, Strength is useless, but you may want a little bit
        of Dexterity for more physical resistance and some basic dodging ability, as many pieces of mage gear come with defense
        bonuses, and staying alive is a top priority for the support healer role. If you're dead, the rest of your group
        is likely to follow. Willpower and Magic should both be very high, kept either equal or with Magic a bit higher than
        Willpower. Willpower gives you a nice big pool of mana for continuous casting, and Magic makes what you're casting
        more effective, such as how many hit points are restored with each cast of Heal. Cunning is just high enough for
        skills, and Constitution is just high enough to give you a comfortable pool of hit points to keep you in the fight
        against archers or other mages. Difficulty rating: Early game - Average to easy Mid game - Easy Late game - Average
        to easy

        <h4 id="debilitator">3.8 - The Debilitator [DAOS3.8]</h4>
        Like the support healer, the debilitator role is a support role that is at its best when it is part of a strong team. However,
        unlike the support healer, the debilitator accomplishes this by weakening and incapacitating the enemy rather than
        bolstering their allies. This build revolves around using the mage's broad arsenal of debuffs and crowd control spells
        to maximum effect. Debilitators don't have the raw killing power of a nuker, but they can layer enough negative status
        effects on their foes to make any darkspawn want to crawl back to one of its broodmother's myriad bloated teats.
        This build will never suffer from having a shortage of spells to choose from. Base Class: Mage Recommended Spells:
        Cone of Cold - this spell will even freeze bosses, leaving them helpless for the duration. Blizzard - unlike with
        the nuker, your interest in this spell is its ability to freeze rather than its damage. Stonefist - knocks down your
        target, and can shatter them if they're frozen. Earthquake - AoE knockdown every pulse. Good crowd control. Glyph
        of Paralysis - lays a stationary AoE that acts like a trap - when an enemy enters its radius, they get paralyzed
        unless they resist. Also half of the tremendously powerful Paralysis Explosion combo (covered later). Glyph of Repulsion
        - useful for all mages but particularly for the debilitator. In addition to keeping you safe and often knocking your
        enemies down, it's the other half of the Paralysis Explosion combo. Glyph of Neutralization - an anti-magic glyph
        that's good for neutralizing enemy casters, as it dispels, drains mana, and prevents spellcasting within its AoE.
        Grease - a stationary trap-like AoE that slows movement and can knock down anyone entering it. Can also be lit on
        fire. Mana Cleanse - wipes out the mana of enemies in the AoE. Force Field - use this to keep powerful enemies, like
        bosses, out of the fight until you can kill off some of their underlings. Crushing Prison - paralysis and a potent
        DoT, difficult to resist. One of the best single target spells in the game. Weakness - debuffs attack, defense, and
        movement speed. Paralyze - single target paralysis. Good for the early levels. Miasma - a caster-centred AoE version
        of Weakness, in the form of a sustained ability. Mass Paralysis - AoE paralysis. A great spell for this build. Vulnerability
        Hex - makes the target susceptible to elemental damage. Great if you also have a nuker in your party. Affliction
        Hex - basically an AoE verison of Vulnerability Hex. Misdirection Hex - turns a single weapon user into a joke; all
        normal attacks miss, and critical hits only do normal damage. Has a long duration as well. Death Hex - turns all
        normal attacks against the target into critical hits. Great for dropping a single enemy really fast, particularly
        if you have dual wielders in your group. Disorient - Similar to Weakness, it debuffs attack and defense. Horror -
        causes a target to cower in fear if they fail a resistance check, effectively paralyzing them. Can't be resisted
        if the target is sleeping. Sleep - an AoE spell that puts targets to sleep. They wake up if hit. Waking Nightmare
        - an AoE spell that causes enemies in its effect to randomly be stunned, attack each other, or become allies of your
        party for its duration. Can't be resisted if the targets are asleep. Curse of Mortality - a spirit DoT that causes
        the target to be unable to heal in any way. Specializations: Blood Mage - a great choice, as it gives you the Blood
        Wound spell, which is easily one of the best AoE crowd control spells in the game. Spirit Healer - a good second
        choice, as it gives helpful bonuses and lets you keep your team in good condition in a pinch. Arcane Warrior - you
        don't really want to incur heavy fatigue penalties, so this specialization would really only be good for throwing
        Shimmering Shield on in a sticky situation. Shapeshifter - while the spider form can use Web, that's hardly worth
        sacrificing the dozens of incapacitating spells you can cast while unshifted. Could be useful for times when you
        run out of mana, but between Death Syphon and lyrium potions (or just use Blood Magic), that really shouldn't happen
        much. General stat spread: Strength - as low as possible Dexterity - as low as possible Willpower - low to moderate,
        depending on how much you use Blood Magic Magic - where the majority of your points should be going; very high Cunning
        - 16 base Constitution - low to moderate, depending on how large a 'pool' you like to have while using Blood Magic
        This is basically the same idea as the nuker build. Strength is useless; Dexterity won't help this build much either.
        Willpower will depend on how much casting you want to be able to do outside of Blood Magic, so this is a matter of
        personal preference. Higher Willpower is necessary to keep up lots of casting if you are not a Blood Mage or only
        use Blood Magic occasionally. Cunning should be base 16 for skill use, as it serves little other purpose for this
        build. Constitution is generally not a priority as you shouldn't be taking much damage, but it increases your mana
        pool and gives you more of a cushion for mishaps while using Blood Magic or facing off against lots of archers. The
        main stat focus of this build is Magic, which should be stacked very high for maximum effectiveness. This has the
        added benefit of making both health poultices (outside of Blood Magic) and lyrium potions extremely effective. Played
        smartly, you'll be able to continuously inflict harmful effects on the enemies throughout even lengthy battles, which
        will rarely be resisted because of your hefty Magic stat. Difficulty rating: Early game - Easy Mid game - Easy Late
        game - Average to easy

        <h4 id="spellsword">3.9 - The Spellsword [DAOS3.9]</h4>
        This role is built around the Arcane Warrior specialization and its unique characteristics. There's a number of ways to go
        about Arcane Warriors, so I'll just try and give a general template with elements that are common in AW loadouts
        I've used and come across. In general, because the Arcane Warrior gains no weapon-specific feats the way rogues and
        warriors do and suffers from very high fatigue penalties, you will do most of your damage through normal weapon swings,
        bolstered by sustained self-buffs. It's not a thrilling play style, but it's extraordinarily effective if designed
        well. You're welcome to mix in a few spellcasts with your melee, but just bear in mind that fatigue will make it
        costly and limited, and many spells cannot be cast with a melee weapon drawn, so you'll have to sheathe it before
        casting. This can add a lot onto the cast time unless you're willing to pause the game and swap your weapon out before
        each cast, which can get tedious pretty fast. You may wish to find offensive spells that can be cast with a drawn
        weapon to streamline things, though there aren't all that many. Base Class: Mage Recommended Spells: Rock Armour
        - as mentioned before, this is a pretty good spell for many mage builds, but it's instrumental in this build as it
        will greatly bolster your survival in melee. Arcane Shield - dodging probably won't be real high on your priority
        list, but this sustained spell probably works better on this build than any other. Flaming/Frost/Telekinetic Weapons
        - getting a weapon enchanting spell is definitely a great investment for this build. Regeneration - a great spell
        to toss onto yourself early in a tough fight. Makes you even harder to kill, which is saying something, and at relatively
        little mana cost. The 'Heroic' buff spell tree - all the spells in this tree are useful, as they improve the melee
        or defensive capabilities of yourself or allies. Spell Shield - despite your impressive defenses, enemy spellcasters
        can still rain on your parade. This can give you some protection while your mana lasts. Miasma - makes you into a
        walking AoE debuff totem, which will make you stand out even more in melee combat. Death Magic - can feed you some
        quick free heals when there's corpses around. Specializations: Arcane Warrior - an obvious choice, since this build
        depends on it. Spirit Healer - the best compliment to the Arcane Warrior, giving some very useful stat bonuses and
        boosting your survival even further. Blood Mage - an interesting choice to pair with a melee-built Arcane Warrior.
        Blood Magic is quite risky when you're on the front lines, but spells like Blood Wound can be very potent if used
        right in this build. Shapeshifter - a poor choice, as changing shape invalidates all the benefits gained from being
        an Arcane Warrior. General stat spread: Strength - as low as possible Dexterity - low to moderate (30 modified or
        less should suffice for most builds) Willpower - moderate to high (roughly 25-40 modified ought to do) Magic - high;
        where most points will probably end up Cunning - 16 base Constitution - moderate (20-30 modified should be plenty
        unless you plan on using Blood Magic a lot) Arcane Warrior stats will vary depending on exactly what you want to
        get out of the build. As with all mages, Strength is useless. The reason why you may want some Dexterity is that
        while Combat Magic makes Magic substitute in for Strength in melee, it is not a perfect substitution, and you will
        never get the same bonus to attack rolls from high Magic that a warrior would get from high Strength. As a result,
        even with very high Magic, your accuracy still won't be that great without buffs. Adding a bit of Dexterity can help
        to offset this as well as giving you a little dodging ability, which can work well with Arcane Shield. Willpower
        should be high enough to run all the sustained abilities you want (at the very least, all of the Arcane Warrior sustained
        spells) for as long as you want. Depending on your style, you may want some extra mana on top to be able to cast
        a few offensive spells, such as an AoE to get enemy hostility, being that you will lack Threaten and Taunt. Cunning
        at base 16 for skills, and Constitution until you feel you have a comfortable enough pool of hit points to survive
        in melee. Your extremely high defensive stats will make Constitution a bit less critical than for other melee characters,
        but it's still good to have a little as a failsafe. The rest of your stat points should go into Magic to boost your
        combat damage, increase the effect of your spells, and make you recover huge amounts from even basic poultices and
        lyrium potions. Difficulty rating: Early game - Average to easy Mid game - Easy Late game - Very easy

        <h4 id="spellCombos">3.10 - A Quick Guide to Spell Combos [DAOS3.10]</h4>
        Grease Fire Component spells: Grease + any fire spell (if you use Flame Blast, you have to hit the centre of the grease)
        Effect: A great big puddle of flaming grease. Shortly after ignition, the grease's effect of tripping people up is
        gone, but it'll continue to burn and inflict a fire DoT on anyone who steps on it for a while. Flame Quencher Component
        spells: make a Grease Fire, then cast Blizzard on it Effect: Gets rid of the grease fire. Storm of the Century Component
        spells: Activate Spell Might, then layer a Blizzard and Tempest on top of each other Effect: Big angry rampaging
        electrical AoE that'll annihilate just about anything that has the misfortune of getting caught in it. If used strategically,
        this spell combo is pretty much game-breaking. Shattering Component spells: use Winter's Grasp, Cone of Cold, or
        Petrify to harden a target. Then, use Earthen Fist, Crushing Prison, or a melee critical hit on them. Effect: The
        target shatters - instant death. Elite-ranked enemies seem to have a chance to avoid it, and boss-types won't be
        affected, but it works quite reliably on any unranked enemies. Paralysis Explosion Component spells: overlap a Glyph
        of Repulsion and a Glyph of Paralysis Effect: A very large radius and long lasting AoE paralysis effect that's nigh
        impossible to resist - even bosses get hit with it quite easily. It causes friendly fire so your party mates will
        probably get hit with it, but a mage running amok with their pick of helpless targets is already a nasty thing. Nightmare
        Component spells: cast Sleep on the desired target, then cast Horror Effect: Wakes the target up, but lays heavy
        duty spirit damage on them as well as the Horror effect. Improved Drain Component spells: start with a Vulnerability
        Hex on the target, then use Life Drain or Mana Drain Effect: Doubled effectiveness of your chosen drain spell. Entropic
        Death Component spells: cast a Death Hex on the desired target, then lay a Death Cloud over them Effect: Enormous
        spirit damage to the target. Basically kills any non-boss (and a few bosses) outright. Shockwave Component spells:
        cast Force Field and Crushing Prison on the same target Effect: A huge shockwave that damages and knocks back everyone
        in its radius. Nearly impossible to resist. The recipient is unhurt by the shockwave. Advanced Reanimation Component
        spells: cast Animate Dead while Spell Might is active Effect: Basically just an improved version of Animate Dead,
        making a more powerful undead ally that has some special abilities.
