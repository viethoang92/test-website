<h3>Noteworthy Gear</h3>
<p>
In this section, I'll cover some gear that stands out as exceptional in some 
way, which you should keep an eye out for to enhance your Warden (or a 
favourite ally). These pieces are often tricky or expensive to acquire, and 
thus represent more endgame-oriented loadouts. For early to mid game, you can 
probably figure it out decently yourself, as there's not an awful lot of 
variation in gear stats at that point for the most part anyway. I'll try and 
minimize spoilers here. Note that I will not be including gear gained through 
special promotional things, like preordering from particular retail outfits 
or getting specialty editions. I am limiting my gear to those found in the 
base installation, The Stone Prisoner, Warden's Keep, and the Blood Dragon 
Armour pieces, as those are what I'm personally familiar with and what most 
people are likely to have access to. I will also leave out gear that exists 
in the base installation but which I personally do not know how to find, as I 
don't like relying solely on third party information for this (not to 
mention, you could look it up as easily as I could). Finally, I will cover 
unique gear types, such as Dog's and Shale's, under the appropriate companion 
building sections later.<br>

<h4 id="aBR">4.1 - Amulets, Belts, and Rings [DAOS4.1]</h4>

AMULETS<br>
<br>
The Spellward<br>
+5 Willpower<br>
+8 Regeneration out of combat<br>
+30% Spell resistance<br>
+10% Chance to dodge attacks<br>
Chance to avoid missile attacks<br>
Where to get it: from Bodahn Feddic in your camp, for around 87 sovereigns<br>
<br>
This is THE amulet in the game, as far as I'm concerned. Once you can afford <br>
it, stick it on your Warden and never look back. It works well on just about <br>
every possible build.<br>
<br>
Lifedrinker<br>
+4 Spellpower<br>
Blood Mage Only<br>
Where to get it: during the Urn of Sacred Ashes quest<br>
<br>
For the hardcore Blood Mage nuker. The best boost in raw magic you can get <br>
from an amulet.<br>
<br>
Magister's Shield<br>
+6 Defense<br>
+4% Spell resistance<br>
-10% Nature resistance<br>
Chance to avoid missile attacks<br>
Where to get it: a sidequest in Denerim<br>
<br>
If you can't afford The Spellward, this is a decent holdover. Its stats also <br>
make it a great choice for giving to a melee rogue or tank companion.<br>
<br>
BELTS<br>
<br>
Andruil's Blessing<br>
+2 to all attributes<br>
+20% Nature resistance<br>
+1 Mana regeneration in combat<br>
+1 Stamina regeneration in combat<br>
+10 Physical resistance<br>
Where to get it: from the templar quartermaster in the Circle tower, for<br>
around 106 sovereigns<br>
<br>
I consider this to be the best all-around belt in the game, giving some <br>
really great bonuses that justify its steep price tag. Works well with just <br>
about any build.<br>
<br>
Archivist's Sash<br>
+50% Experience from codex entry finds<br>
Where to get it: from The Wonders of Thedas in Denerim for less than a <br>
sovereign<br>
<br>
Not something you want to wear all the time, but it gives a nice little exp <br>
boost if you slip it on just before getting codex unlocks.<br>
<br>
Destructionist's Belt<br>
+0.5 Mana regeneration in combat<br>
+3 Spellpower<br>
Where to get it: bought from Ruck in the Deep Roads<br>
<br>
A solid choice for a spellcaster ally, regardless of their role.<br>
<br>
RINGS<br>
<br>
Lifegiver<br>
+10 Constitution<br>
+3 Health regeneration in combat<br>
+2.5 Health regeneration out of combat<br>
+3 Armour<br>
+20% to healing received<br>
Where to get it: from Garin in Orzammar for around 87 sovereigns<br>
<br>
Easily one of the best rings in the game, particularly if you find yourself <br>
feeling a little too fragile but don't want to spend a ton of points boosting <br>
your Constitution. A hefty price tag, but well worth it, especially to melee <br>
characters.<br>
<br>
Key to the City<br>
+2 to all attributes<br>
+4% Spell resistance<br>
+10% to healing received<br>
Where to get it: an Orzammar sidequest<br>
<br>
A great little ring that's surprisingly easy (and free) to get. One of my <br>
favourite endgame choices.<br>
<br>
Ring of the Warrior<br>
+2 Strength<br>
+2 Dexterity<br>
Where to get it: a Deep Roads sidequest<br>
<br>
Great stat bonuses for melee or archer characters, and it's free!<br>
<br>
Seal of Rat Red<br>
+10 Physical resistance<br>
+10 Mental resistance<br>
Where to get it: related to a Mages' Collective sidequest<br>
<br>
A ring that gives a nice boost for resisting nasty status effects, <br>
particularly in the early game when everyone's stats are low.<br>
<br>
Harvest Festival Ring<br>
+2 Strength<br>
+2 Dexterity<br>
+4 Attack<br>
Warrior or Rogue only<br>
Where to get it: Shale's quests<br>
<br>
Like a Ring of the Warrior but better! However, mages (most notably Arcane <br>
Warriors) can't use it.<br>
<br>
Dawn Ring<br>
+4 Strength<br>
-1 Cunning<br>
Where to get it: during the final battles<br>
<br>
A nice ring for any melee warrior, as the tradeoff is well worth it. Too bad <br>
you only get it very late in the game. Half of the Imperium Rings set, which <br>
gives +2 Armour.<br>
<br>
Dusk Ring<br>
+3 Cunning<br>
-1 Strength<br>
Where to get it: exploration during the Nature of the Beast quest<br>
<br>
A great ring for rogues. The other half of the Imperium Rings set, which <br>
gives +2 Armour. Worn together, the two rings offset each others' penalties <br>
to become purely positive stat bonuses.<br>
<br>
<h4 id="mageArmour">4.2 - Mage Armour [DAOS4.2]</h4>

HATS<br>
<br>
Just want to start by saying that every last one of these makes you look like<br>
a complete and utter tool. You've been warned.<br>
<br>
First Enchanter's Cowl<br>
+4% Spell resistance<br>
+10% Chance to dodge attacks<br>
Where to get it: from Bodahn Feddic after the Landsmeet<br>
<br>
One of the better cowls out there for boosting your mage's survivability. Not <br>
too pricey either, but only available late in the game.<br>
<br>
The Libertarian's Cowl<br>
+12 Defense<br>
+0.25 Mana regeneration in combat<br>
Where to get it: found during the Broken Circle quests<br>
<br>
As good a cowl as you're likely to find throughout most of the game. Mana <br>
regeneration is almost always welcome, and the defense bonus is quite large.<br>
<br>
ROBES<br>
<br>
Reaper's Vestments<br>
+6 Constitution<br>
+20% Fire resistance<br>
+16% Spell resistance<br>
+10% Chance to dodge attacks<br>
+12 Armour<br>
Where to get it: From The Wonders of Thedas in Denerim for 90ish sovereigns<br>
<br>
My favourite as far as robes go, these offer a truly massive boost to the <br>
sturdiness of your average squishy mage. They give more armour than a lot of <br>
top tier leathers, and have other great bonuses - I'm always a sucker for <br>
spell resistance.<br>
<br>
First Enchanter's Robes<br>
+3 Willpower<br>
+3 Magic<br>
+9 Defense<br>
Where to get it: from Cesar's special stock for around 5 sovereigns<br>
<br>
Basically an improved version of Wynne's Senior Enchanter robes. A solid low <br>
cost choice.<br>
<br>
Robes of Avernus<br>
+3 Willpower<br>
+3 Armour<br>
Improves Blood Magic<br>
Where to get it: Warden's Keep quests<br>
<br>
A bit of a mediocre option unless you're a Blood Mage, in which case its <br>
bonus to your spell costs under Blood Magic make it a natural choice.<br>
<br>
Robes of Possession<br>
+5 Magic<br>
+12 Defense<br>
+8% Spell resistance<br>
-1 Willpower<br>
+20% Cold damage<br>
Morrigan only<br>
Where to get it: Morrigan's personal quest<br>
<br>
This is probably the robe you'll have Morrigan end out the game with, unless <br>
you want to get her Reaper's Vestments.<br>
<br>
Tevinter Mage Robes<br>
+1 Mana regeneration in combat<br>
+5 Spellpower<br>
+4% Spell resistance<br>
Where to get it: From The Wonders of Thedas in Denerim for around 6<br>
sovereigns, or from the Dalish origin if you're sneaky<br>
<br>
A really great all-around robe for any kind of mage, especially due to how <br>
early in the game Dalish characters can get it. Great bang for your buck.<br>
<br>
GLOVES<br>
<br>
Mage gloves are pretty straightforward - they're basically leather gloves <br>
that give bonuses to particular types of elemental damage. Just equip the <br>
best pair you can find that boosts your most-used element. Only one set <br>
really stands out at all.<br>
<br>
Elementalist's Grasp<br>
Armour 1.33 (Tier 6 light)<br>
Fatigue 1.13%<br>
+5% damage from all element types<br>
Mage only<br>
Where to get it: a Denerim sidequest<br>
<br>
The only gloves that boost all elemental damage rather than a single type, <br>
making them a good option for the multi-element nuker.<br>
<br>
SHOES<br>
<br>
Fade Striders<br>
Armour 0.75 (Tier 1 light)<br>
Fatigue 0.50%<br>
+1 Magic<br>
Mage only<br>
Where to get it: the Mage origin story<br>
<br>
Despite the otherwise crappy stats, these shoes can be worth using for those <br>
that wish to maximize their spellcasting performance, as they are the only <br>
footwear that provide a boost to your Magic stat.<br>
<br>
Magus War Boots<br>
Armour 2.25 (Tier 7 light)<br>
Fatigue 0.57%<br>
+12 Defense<br>
Mage only<br>
Where to get it: A Chantry board sidequest<br>
<br>
Solid armour and a huge dodging boost make this a good choice for any mage.<br>
<br>
Imperial Weavers<br>
Armour 0.75 (Tier 1 light)<br>
Fatigue 0.50%<br>
+10% Chance to dodge attacks<br>
Mage only<br>
Where to get it: from Bodahn Feddic in your camp<br>
<br>
With a little investment, these boots can be acquired early on, and provide a <br>
nice little defensive boost.<br>
<br>

<br>
NOTEWORTHY SETS<br>
<br>
General sets:<br>
<br>
Duster Leather Armour<br>
Total set bonus: +2 Armour<br>
Where to get it: Orzammar<br>
<br>
For dwarf commoners and those who head to Orzammar earlier rather than later, <br>
this humble set can provide valuable added damage absorption.<br>
<br>
Dalish Armour<br>
Total set bonus: +2 Dexterity, +8 Defense<br>
Where to get it: Dalish camps, Nature of the Beast quest line<br>
<br>
For Dalish elves and those who head to the Brecilian forest, this basic <br>
armour set can give fantastic bonuses to rogues that can easily outweigh <br>
armour value.<br>
<br>
Unique sets:<br>
<br>
Wade's Superior Drakeskin - Tier 7 (Drakeskin)<br>
SET PIECE	                         ARMOUR FATIGUE BONUSES<br>
Wade's Superior Drakeskin Leather Armour  9.00	 2.30%  +2 Dexterity	<br>
			                                +50% Fire Resistance  	<br>
Wade's Superior Drakeskin Gloves	  1.50	 1.15%	+1 Dexterity<br>
			                                +10% Fire Resistance	<br>
Wade's Superior Drakeskin Boots	          2.25	 0.57%	+1 Dexterity<br>
			                                +10% Fire Resistance	<br>
Set Bonus: +5 Defense, -10% Fatigue<br>
Prerequisite: 20 Strength<br>
Where to get it: From Wade's Emporium with the right components<br>
<br>
A decent set for Dexterity and dodge-based characters, and for any <br>
dragonkilling exploits you may undertake.<br>
<br>
HELMETS<br>
<br>
Armsman's Tensioner<br>
Armour 2.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Rapid Aim<br>
+6 Attack<br>
18 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: from Varathorn after a few major quest arcs<br>
<br>
A great helmet for any archer that wants to use a bow without the Rapid Aim <br>
property on it. Unfortunately, it doesn't become available until rather late <br>
in the game.<br>
<br>
Longrunner's Cap<br>
Armour 1.75 (Tier 5)<br>
+0.5 Stamina regeneration in combat<br>
17 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: the Paragon of Her Kind quest line<br>
<br>
You can actually get two of these as acquisitions over the course of the <br>
quest line. Great mid to late game light helmets, as stamina is always handy.<br>
<br>
The Long Sight<br>
Armour 2.25 (Tier 7)<br>
+5% Ranged critical chance<br>
20 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: an optional fight in the Urn of Sacred Ashes quest<br>
<br>
Probably the best all-around light archer helmet, as it gives good protection <br>
and a great bonus. Ranged critical boosts are hard to find. Can also be <br>
obtained for free relatively early on if you fight smart.<br>
<br>
MAIN ARMOUR<br>
<br>
Shadow of the Empire<br>
Armour 9.00 (Tier 7)<br>
Fatigue 2.30%<br>
+2 Strength<br>
+2 Dexterity<br>
+1 Stamina regeneration in combat<br>
20 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: from Legnar for around 20 sovereigns<br>
<br>
A really nice light armour, which can be acquired quite early with its <br>
reasonable price tag. An excellent mid game armour piece, or an endgame piece <br>
for one of your allies.<br>
<br>
The Felon's Coat<br>
Armour 9.00 (Tier 7)<br>
Fatigue 2.30%<br>
+6 Dexterity<br>
+9 Defense<br>
+4 Armour<br>
+1 Stamina regeneration in combat<br>
+15 Physical resistance<br>
20 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: From Wade's Emporium in Denerim after a few major quest <br>
arcs, for around 90ish sovereigns<br>
<br>
Though it comes with a hefty price tag and can't be obtained until mid game <br>
at the earliest, The Felon's Coat is pretty much the light armour piece in <br>
the game. It comes with bonuses in nearly everything a budding rogue could <br>
possibly want from their armour. There's few games where I don't buy this <br>
either for the Warden or for a rogue ally.<br>
<br>
GLOVES<br>
<br>
Gloves of Guile<br>
Armour 1.50 (Tier 7)<br>
Fatigue 1.15%<br>
+2.5 Armour penetration<br>
20 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: from a random Denerim encounter during the Landsmeet arc<br>
<br>
These gloves offer the largest armour penetration bonus of any piece of <br>
armour in the game. A bit of a niche piece, but if you're dual wielding <br>
longswords or want to make your arrows even more deadly against heavily <br>
armoured targets, it may be up your alley. Only acquired quite late in the <br>
game, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
Pushback Strikers<br>
Armour 1.50 (Tier 7)<br>
Fatigue 1.15%<br>
+5% Melee critical chance<br>
20 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: as part of the Paragon of Her Kind quest line<br>
<br>
One of the best, if not the best, pairs of gloves for dual wielders, as 5% is <br>
a sizeable boost. Can also be gotten quite early on, and for free!<br>
<br>
Red Jenny Seekers<br>
Armour 1.50 (Tier 7)<br>
Fatigue 1.15%<br>
+15% Critical/backstab damage<br>
20 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: end reward for a Denerim side quest<br>
<br>
A solid alternative to the Pushback Strikers, these make your crits bigger <br>
rather than more frequent. I'm not sure if this works for ranged crits or <br>
not. For the frequent backstabber, these are an excellent choice.<br>
<br>
BOOTS<br>
<br>
Antivan Leather Boots<br>
Armour 2.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Fatigue 0.56%<br>
+4% Spell resistance<br>
18 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: found during the Urn of Sacred Ashes quest (hint: starts as <br>
a gift)<br>
<br>
A bit of a niche choice, depending on how much trouble those pesky mages are <br>
giving you. The only light footwear that provides protection against <br>
spellcasting.<br>
<br>
Bard's Dancing Shoes<br>
Armour 2.25 (Tier 7)<br>
Fatigue 0.57%<br>
+6 Defense<br>
Reduces enemy hostility<br>
20 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: From Bodahn Feddic in your camp<br>
<br>
A good early to mid game choice, as it gives a rather nice defensive boost. <br>
Great for dishing out damage without pulling enemies off your tank.<br>
<br>
<h4 id="mediumArmour">4.4 - Medium Armour [DAOS4.4]</h4>

NOTEWORTHY SETS<br>
<br>
Ancient Elven Armour - Tier 4 (Veridium)<br>
SET PIECE	      ARMOUR  FATIGUE   BONUSES<br>
Ancient Elven Helm     1.60    1.72%	+25% Spirit Resistance<br>

Ancient Elven Boots    1.60    1.72%	+1 Constitution<br>
<br>
Set Bonus: +5 Defense<br>
Prerequisite: 22 Strength<br>
Where to get it: Various (Lothering, Brecilian Forest, Urn of Sacred Ashes<br>
zones)<br>
<br>
Not a fantastic set, considering how much trouble you have to go to in order <br>
to put it together, but it has low Strength requirements. Most noteworthy are <br>
the gloves, which give excellent protective bonuses and are well worth using <br>
outside the set.<br>
<br>
Wade's Superior Dragonskin Armour - Tier 7 (Dragonbone)<br>
SET PIECE	                   ARMOUR  FATIGUE  BONUSES<br>
Wade's Superior Dragonskin Armour  10.63    9.10%   +1 Stamina Regeneration<br>
			                            +50% Fire Resistance	<br>

			                            +10% Fire Resistance	<br>
Set Bonus: +5 Defense, -25% Fatigue<br>
Prerequisite: 34 Strength<br>
Where to get it: From Wade's Emporium with the right components<br>
<br>
Quite a solid choice for any medium armour user, this set provides a lot of <br>
very useful stamina-related bonuses, as well as a boatload of fire <br>
resistance, which is one of the more useful elemental resistances in the <br>
game. Also leaves your helmet slot free. Has the heavy duty protective value <br>
of Tier 7 equipment, but with the correspondingly high Strength prerequisite.<br>
<br>
HELMETS<br>
<br>
Camenae's Barbute<br>
Armour 2.10 (Tier 6)<br>
Fatigue 1.88%<br>
Rapid Aim<br>
Chance to avoid missile attacks<br>
30 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: From Gorim in Denerim after completing a couple major quest <br>
arcs<br>
<br>
A great helmet for crossbow users, as crossbows with Rapid Aim are relatively <br>
rare and crossbow Wardens are likely to have enough Strength to equip it. The <br>
missile avoidance bonus works well on archers too.<br>
<br>
MAIN ARMOUR<br>
<br>
Varathorn's Armour<br>
Armour 8.92 (Tier 6)<br>
Fatigue 8.75%<br>
+3 Armour<br>
+20% Nature resistance<br>
+25 Stamina<br>
30 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: Made by Varathorn as part of a side quest<br>
<br>
A great choice for a medium main armour, especially since it can be gained <br>
for free quite early in the game. Very high protective value for medium <br>
armour with nice bonuses.<br>
<br>
BOOTS<br>
<br>
Cadash Stompers<br>
Armour 2.66 (Tier 6 leather, don't ask)<br>
Fatigue 1.69%<br>
+2 Dexterity<br>
+2 Armour<br>
+2% Ranged critical chance<br>
+2% Melee critical chance<br>
Increases hostility<br>
22 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: Shale's quests<br>
<br>
These boots don't fit cleanly into any category, as they possess a sort of <br>
mishmosh of the qualities of light, medium, and heavy armour, with stats <br>
averaging out roughly into the medium armour category. These boots have <br>
outstanding bonuses, particularly for tank characters due to their <br>
surprisingly high armour value, Dexterity bonus, and increase in hostility. <br>
However, they also work great on DPS characters so long as you don't mind the <br>
possibility of pulling enemies off your tank.<br>
<br>
<h4 id="heavyArmour">4.5 - Heavy Armour [DAOS4.5]</h4><br>
<br>
NOTEWORTHY SETS<br>
<br>
Armour of Diligence - Tier 6 (Silverite)<br>
SET PIECE	     ARMOUR  FATIGUE  BONUSES<br>
Armour of Diligence  13.12   17.50%   +0.5 Health Regeneration<br>

Set Bonus: +5 Willpower<br>
Prerequisite: 34 Strength<br>
Where to get it: Various locations (Orzammar, Redcliffe, Urn of Sacred Ashes <br>
zones)<br>
<br>
What makes this set stand out so much is its outstanding protective value for <br>
heavy armour. The gloves have better armour than any other pair in the game, <br>
including the best massive varieties. A great set choice for a heavy armour <br>
user, and pieces of the set are exceptionally useful even on massive armour <br>
tanks.<br>

This set sports identical bonuses to the medium variety, with higher armour <br>
and correspondingly higher fatigue and Strength prereqs. A solid choice for <br>
any heavy armour user.<br>
<br>
HELMETS<br>
<br>
Helm of Honnleath<br>
Armour 1.50 (Tier 2)<br>
Fatigue 2.36%<br>
+2 to All Attributes<br>
+3 Armour<br>
20 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: Shale's quests<br>
<br>
My personal favourite helm for your main character, as it has low enough <br>
Strength prereqs that even rogues can easily access it, and it gives an <br>
excellent blend of bonuses and protective value - despite only being grey <br>
iron, it has better armour absorption than nearly any other helm in the game.<br>
<br>
Executioner's Helm<br>
Armour 2.00 (Tier 4)<br>
Fatigue 2.59%<br>
+25 Stamina<br>
26 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: Various ways in Denerim<br>
<br>
Provides a rather large stamina boost for a helmet. Other than that, it's not <br>
too remarkable.<br>
<br>
MAIN ARMOUR<br>
<br>
Evon the Great's Mail<br>
Armour 15.63 (Tier 7)<br>
Fatigue 18.20%<br>
+1 Health regeneration in combat<br>
+6 Armour<br>
+10% Chance to dodge attacks<br>
+1 Stamina regeneration in combat<br>
Chance to avoid missile attacks<br>
38 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: From Wade's Emporium in Denerim after completing a couple <br>
major quest lines, for 100ish sovereigns<br>
<br>
An outstanding piece of armour, offering damage absorption comparable to top <br>
tier massive gear and with a ton of other great bonuses, which justify its <br>
hefty price tag. A good choice for any heavy armour user.<br>

Armour of the Legion   21.88   27.30%  +3 Willpower<br>
Gloves of the Legion   3.13    3.90%   +4 Attack<br>
Boots of the Legion    3.75    3.90%   None<br>
<br>
Set Bonus: +3 Constitution, +3 Damage<br>
Prerequisite: 42 Strength<br>
Where to get it: The Deep Roads<br>
<br>
This set is oriented toward heavy duty damage output, with the survivability <br>
to let you dish it out. On top of that, it looks incredible, particularly on <br>
large hulking characters like Sten. There is also a helmet and shield that go <br>
with this set visually, but they are not necessary to get the set bonus.<br>
<br>
Blood Dragon Armour - Tier 6 (Silverite)<br>

<br>
Set Bonus: +3 Armour, +1 Defense, +1 Missile deflection<br>
Prerequisite: 38 Strength<br>
Where to get it: The plate is automatically in your inventory when you <br>
activate the DLC; the rest can be bought from Bodahn Feddic for around 3 <br>
sovereigns each<br>
<br>
The Blood Dragon Plate is what truly stands out in this set, as you get it <br>
for free right from the start of the game and it has an astonishing number of <br>
useful bonuses for a single piece of armour, making it a great choice for any <br>
character with enough Strength to equip it. The helmet also has excellent <br>
armour protection values. The lack of bonuses on the gauntlets and boots <br>
means you may want to mix and match rather than go for the set bonus.<br>
<br>
Juggernaut Plate - Tier 6 (Silverite)<br>

Set Bonus: +3 Strength, +3 Constitution<br>
Prerequisite: 38 Strength<br>
Where to get it: The Nature of the Beast quest locations<br>
<br>
Elemental damage putting hair on your cake? This is the set for you. While it <br>
tends to lag behind a lot of the other massive armour sets in terms of raw <br>
armour protection value, it gives unsurpassed broad spectrum elemental <br>
resistance. The helm is also quite a nice piece as a standalone.<br>
<br>

Warden Commander Boots	 Varies	 Varies	  +50 Stamina<br>
<br>
Set Bonus: +10 Health, -10% Fatigue<br>
Prerequisites: Dependent on tier<br>
Where to get it: Warden's Keep quests<br>
<br>
What stands out the most in this set are the boots, giving a whopping 50 <br>
stamina. The main armour gives some rather nice bonuses as well. Mediocre <br>
gloves and a set bonus that's a little on the anemic side mean that you may <br>
wish to only use pieces of this set rather than the whole thing. Its material <br>
varies depending on the level of your main character when you acquire it, <br>
with higher tiers corresponding to higher levels. It'll never be worse than <br>
steel and never be better than dragonbone. Either wait to go to the Keep <br>
until it hits tier 7, or go earlier and sell the pieces to a merchant with a <br>
low markup and buy it back when it upgrades to dragonbone.<br>
<br>

Set Bonus: +5 Defense, -25% Fatigue<br>
Prerequisite: 42 Strength<br>
Where to get it: From Wade's Emporium with the right components<br>
<br>
The bonuses are identical to the medium and heavy variants of this set, but <br>
obviously this version offers the highest armour values at the highest <br>
fatigue cost. This version tends to stand out less than the medium and heavy <br>
sets because there are so many other good massive armour sets in the game to <br>
choose from.<br>
<br>
Effort's Armour - Tier 6 (Silverite)<br>

Effort's Boots	  3.15	  3.75%	  +1 Armour<br>
<br>
Set Bonus: -10% Fatigue<br>
Prerequisites: 38 Strength<br>
Where to get it: Orzammar and the Deep Roads<br>
<br>
Probably the crappiest unique massive armour set, Effort nonetheless has a <br>
couple pieces that offer some useful bonuses on their own.<br>
<br>

+5 Dexterity<br>

42 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: Denerim during the final battles<br>
<br>
Packing the highest armour value of any helmet in the game, as well as a <br>
terrific Dexterity boost, this helmet is Alistair's dream come true. Too bad <br>
the game's almost over by the time you get it.<br>
<br>
MAIN ARMOUR<br>
<br>
Knight Commander's Plate<br>
Armour 18.90 (Tier 6)<br>
Fatigue 27.50%<br>
+5 Willpower<br>
+40% Spell resistance<br>
+10 Mental resistance<br>
Templar only<br>
39 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: bought from Faryn for around 27 sovereigns<br>
<br>
I have an unhealthy love of this armour. Because I don't abuse Mana Clash, <br>
mages are the most dangerous and obnoxious enemies I face in any given <br>
playthrough, and this armour does a tremendous amount to let me laugh in <br>
their overpowered faces. 40% spell resistance from a single piece of gear is <br>
amazing, and the other bonuses are great as well. I take Templar as a <br>
specialization on a lot of my warriors just so I can wear this armour, or <br>
stick it on Alistair as soon as I can if I'm playing a rogue. In my <br>
experience, the ability to shrug off spells definitely offsets the extra <br>
couple of armour points you could get from a different piece, though Blood <br>
Dragon is always tempting just due to all the other amazing bonuses it gives.<br>
<br>

+1% Melee critical chance<br>
+10% to healing received<br>
18 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: The Nature of the Beast quest areas<br>

About as good as bucklers get. Decent little bonuses for a shield with <br>
relatively low prereqs and no fatigue penalty.<br>
<br>
Ruck's Shield<br>
Defense 1.50 (Tier 3)<br>
Missile Deflection 2.25<br>
+4 Attack<br>
+10% Spirit resistance<br>

+4 Damage vs Darkspawn<br>

dwarf nobles as far as I know.<br>

Fatigue 3.13%<br>
+12 Defense<br>

An easily acquired shield that will give a boost to your tank's dodging until <br>
better shields become available.<br>

Missile Deflection 5.06<br>
Fatigue 3.13%<br>

Missile Deflection 4.50<br>
Fatigue 3.52%<br>
+6 Defense<br>
+25 Stamina<br>
22 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: Redcliffe quests<br>
<br>
The combination of two key stat bonuses for shieldtanks - Defense and <br>
Stamina - make this shield a great early to mid game choice.<br>
<br>
Havard's Aegis<br>
Defense 4.00 (Tier 3)<br>
Missile Deflection 4.50<br>
Fatigue 3.36%<br>
+4% Spell resistance<br>
Chance to avoid missile attacks<br>
22 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: Ostagar quests<br>
<br>
For a shield you get very early on in the game, Havard's Aegis has extremely <br>
useful bonuses. You can continue using this for most of the game and do just <br>
fine.<br>
<br>
Redcliffe Elite Shield<br>
Defense 4.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Missile Deflection 6.00<br>
Fatigue 3.84%<br>
+1 Willpower<br>

+15% Electricity resistance<br>
+2 Attack<br>
32 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: the Urn of Sacred Ashes quest as a rogue or warrior<br>
<br>
Sporting a well-rounded set of bonuses, this shield makes a viable <br>
alternative to Eamon's Shield or Havard's Aegis for the mid game.<br>
<br>
HEAVY SHIELDS<br>
<br>
Duncan's Shield<br>
Defense 6.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Missile Deflection 9.00<br>
Fatigue 6.00%<br>
+3 Willpower<br>
+6 Defense<br>
+1 Stamina regeneration in combat<br>
38 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: Denerim after the Landsmeet is assembled<br>
<br>
This shield has an excellent bonus set for shieldtanks. Too bad it's only <br>
obtainable quite late in the game.<br>
<br>
Earthheart's Portable Bulwark<br>
Defense 6.00 (Tier 5)<br>
Missile Deflection 8.00<br>
Fatigue 5.76%<br>
+1 Strength<br>
+1 Dexterity<br>
+1 Constitution<br>
36 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: From Bodahn Feddic for under 10 sovereigns<br>
<br>
For the shieldtank who prefers stat bonuses to raw defensive value. Nice <br>
because of how early in the game you can acquire it, if you so choose.<br>
<br>
Fade Wall<br>
Defense 6.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Missile Deflection 9.00<br>
Fatigue 6.00%<br>
+3 Defense<br>
+20% to healing received<br>
+1 Stamina regeneration in combat<br>
+25 Stamina<br>
38 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: possible drop from a side quest in Denerim near the end of <br>
the game<br>
<br>
A solid alternative to Duncan's Shield, available around the same time in the <br>
game. A little less raw defense but better stamina capabilities, and the <br>
healing boost can be quite beneficial, especially if your tank is rolling <br>
heavier on Constitution than Dexterity.<br>
<br>
Howe's Shield<br>
Defense 6.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Missile Deflection 9.00<br>
Fatigue 6.00%<br>
+12 Defense<br>
+10% Fire resistance<br>
+10% Cold resistance<br>
-2 Willpower<br>
38 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: Denerim just prior to the Landsmeet<br>
<br>
Sort of like the Champion's Shield's big brother, this shield provides a <br>
whopping bonus to your dodging and some useful elemental resists, but the <br>
penalty to Willpower is a bit unsexy. And it belonged to Arl Howe. Icky. <br>
Still, not a bad shield.<br>
<br>
<h4 id="wML">4.8 - Waraxes, Maces, and Longswords [DAOS4.8]</h4><br>
<br>
WARAXES<br>
<br>
All waraxes have a Strength modifier of 1.10.<br>
Defining characteristic: Higher Strength modifier than any other one-handed <br>
weapon type, giving better damage with very high Strength values.<br>
<br>
The Veshialle<br>
Damage 9.60 (Tier 7)<br>
Critical Chance 1.60%<br>
Armour Penetration 4.00<br>
3 rune slots<br>
+2 Strength<br>
+5% Melee critical chance<br>
+1 Stamina regeneration in combat<br>
+10% Critical/backstab damage<br>
+2 Nature damage<br>
31 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: From Bodahn Feddic for around 145ish sovereigns<br>
<br>
Though it comes with a heavy price tag, the Veshialle is the best waraxe in <br>
the game and a heavy contender for best melee weapon. One of the only unique <br>
dragonbone axes, and thus one of the only ones that can take three runes. A <br>
great choice, particularly if you have high Strength values or a high <br>
critical rate. Almost perfectly suited to dual wielding builds.<br>
<br>
Axe of the Grey<br>
Damage 9.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Critical Chance 1.50%<br>
Armour Penetration 3.50<br>
2 rune slots<br>
+3% Melee critical chance<br>
+2 Armour penetration<br>
+6 Damage vs darkspawn<br>
27 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: in Denerim after the Landsmeet is assembled<br>
<br>
A solid all-around axe that really shines in the last battles, as all your <br>
enemies are darkspawn. Also quite good against more heavily armoured targets.<br>
<br>
Aodh<br>
Damage 9.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Critical Chance 1.50%<br>
Armour Penetration 3.50<br>
2 rune slots<br>
+3% Melee critical chance<br>
+20% Fire resistance<br>
-5% Cold resistance<br>
+1 Fire damage<br>
27 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: part of a Denerim side quest<br>
<br>
One of the main advantages to this axe is that it can be obtained fairly <br>
early in the game. Its one drawback is relatively minor compared to its <br>
bonuses.<br>
<br>
Bloodline<br>
Base stats vary with tier<br>
+3 Dexterity<br>
+10% Spirit resistance<br>
+1 Armour penetration<br>
+4 Damage vs darkspawn<br>
Where to get it: the Deep Roads<br>
<br>
The tier of this axe will depend on your level when you acquire it, but it <br>
can go as high as tier 7. You can use the sell/re-buy later trick to upgrade <br>
it. The other unique axe that can have 3 rune slots, and with a pretty decent <br>
spread of bonuses.<br>
<br>
MACES<br>
<br>
All maces have a Strength modifier of 1.00.<br>
Defining characteristic: Far and away the best armour penetration of any one-<br>
handed weapons.<br>
<br>
High Constable's Mace<br>
Damage 7.50 (Tier 6)<br>
Critical Chance 0.75%<br>
Armour Penetration 7.00<br>
2 rune slots<br>
+1 Stamina regeneration in combat<br>
+6 Damage vs darkspawn<br>
28 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: Denerim after the Landsmeet is called<br>
<br>
A bit of a mediocre weapon against anything but darkspawn, especially given <br>
that you only get it quite late in the game, but it's still worth considering <br>
for the final confrontation where its damage bonus will really come in handy.<br>
<br>
Vanguard<br>
Damage 7.50 (Tier 6)<br>
Critical Chance 0.75%<br>
Armour Penetration 7.00<br>
2 rune slots<br>
+3 Strength<br>
+3 Constitution<br>
+1 Stamina regeneration in combat<br>
28 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: the Paragon of Her Kind quest line<br>
<br>
Probably the best all-around mace in the game, with decent stat boosts and <br>
ever-useful stamina regeneration.<br>
<br>
Longswords<br>
<br>
All longswords have a Strength modifier of 1.00.<br>
Defining characteristic: Excellent base damage and critical hit rate.<br>
<br>
Starfang<br>
Damage 11.90 (Tier 8)<br>
Critical Chance 3.40%<br>
Armour Penetration 4.20<br>
3 rune slots<br>
+3 Dexterity<br>
+3 Damage<br>
+2.5 Armour Penetration<br>
31 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: Warden's Keep quests<br>
<br>
The clear choice for those with the Warden's Keep DLC, this longsword <br>
outperforms nearly any other one-hander, and best of all, it's free. On top <br>
of its outstanding base stats, being in the unique 'Tier 8' of Starmetal <br>
materials, it gets bonuses that help to overcome the inherent drawbacks of <br>
using longswords and help you crank out excellent damage, with 3 rune slots <br>
for versatility. Not to mention it looks pretty sweet.<br>
<br>
Spellweaver<br>
Damage 10.50 (Tier 6)<br>
Critical Chance 3.00%<br>
Armour Penetration 3.50<br>
2 rune slots<br>
+5 Magic<br>
+1 Mana regeneration in combat<br>
+10% Spell resistance<br>
+3 Electricity damage<br>
Arcane Warrior only<br>
Where to get it: The Urn of Sacred Ashes quests<br>
<br>
This sword can only be wielded by mages with the Arcane Warrior <br>
specialization, and when you take a peek at its stats, it becomes clear that <br>
this weapon is admirably suited to that role. A near perfect fit for melee <br>
Arcane Warriors.<br>
<br>
Keening Blade<br>
Damage 11.20 (Tier 7)<br>
Critical Chance 3.20%<br>
Armour Penetration 4.00<br>
3 rune slots<br>
+2 Armour penetration<br>
+6 Attack<br>
+3 Cold damage<br>
Warrior only<br>
31 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: a Denerim side quest later in the game<br>
<br>
Sort of like Starfang's little brother in the stats department, the Keening <br>
Blade offers a very nice stat spread and three rune slots, and it doesn't <br>
cost you a penny. If you went for the Starfang greatsword or don't have <br>
Warden's Keep, this is a great choice for an endgame 1-hander<br>
<br>
<h4 id="bGM">4.9 - Battleaxes, Greatswords, and Mauls [DAOS4.9]</h4>

BATTLEAXES<br>
<br>
All battleaxes have a Strength modifier of 1.10.<br>
Defining characteristic: Very high critical hit rate for a two-handed weapon.<br>
<br>
Faith's Edge<br>
Damage 15.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Critical Chance 4.50%<br>
Armour Penetration 5.25<br>
2 rune slots<br>
+2 Willpower<br>
+5% Critical/backstab damage<br>
34 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: part of a fight in the Urn of Sacred Ashes quest<br>
<br>
A decent choice for a two-hander, though its stats are not particularly v
noteworthy compared to some of the other weapons on offer. Mostly good to use <br>
if you happen to like the aesthetic of battleaxes versus greatswords or mauls.<br>
<br>
Maetashear War Axe<br>
Damage 15.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Critical Chance 4.50%<br>
Armour Penetration 5.25<br>
2 rune slots<br>
+1 Damage<br>
+5% Melee critical chance<br>
-1 Dexterity<br>
34 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: an optional fight in the Urn of Sacred Ashes arc<br>
<br>
An alternative to Faith's Edge with comparable stats, this axe leans a little <br>
more heavily toward raw damage output.<br>
<br>
GREATSWORDS<br>
<br>
All greatswords have a Strength modifier of 1.10.<br>
Defining characteristic: Very high base damage.<br>

Where to get it: an optional fight in the Orzammar palace<br>
<br>
This sword is most noteworthy for the bonuses against darkspawn, since you <br>
spend so much of the game fighting against darkspawn enemies. The major <br>
drawback to using this blade is that it has no rune slots.<br>
<br>
Meteor Sword<br>
Damage 16.50 (Tier 6)<br>
Critical Chance 2.25%<br>
Armour Penetration 5.25<br>
2 rune slots<br>
+2 Strength<br>
+3 Damage<br>
-25% Spirit resistance<br>
34 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: bought from Gorim after a few storyline quests<br>
<br>
An interesting alternative to swords like Ageless and Yusaris, this <br>
greatsword is more oriented toward raw damage output against any target. The <br>
spirit resistance penalty can be a bit of a bummer if you fight things that <br>
love using Crushing Prison, like Genlock Emissaries.<br>
<br>
Starfang<br>
Damage 18.70 (Tier 8)<br>
Critical Chance 2.55%<br>
Armour Penetration 6.30<br>
3 rune slots<br>
+3 Strength<br>
+2.5 Armour penetration<br>
+8 Attack<br>
38 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: Warden's Keep with the right materials<br>
<br>
A quintessential choice for most of the game as a two-handed user, Starfang <br>
provides solid performance across a number of fronts - high autoattack <br>
damage, 3 rune slots for great flexibility, and other useful built-in <br>
bonuses. Can make a perfectly serviceable endgame weapon if you like <br>
greatswords.<br>
<br>
Mauls<br>
<br>
All mauls have a Strength modifier of 1.25.<br>
Defining characteristic: Highest Strength modifier of any weapon type in the <br>
game; outstanding armour penetration.<br>
<br>
Chasind Great Maul<br>
Damage 14.40 (Tier 7)<br>
Critical Chance 0.80%<br>
Armour Penetration 14.00<br>
3 rune slots<br>
+5 Damage<br>
+2.5 Armour Penetration<br>
+0.5 Stamina regeneration<br>
+75 Stamina<br>
38 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: from Gorim in Denerim after a few storyline quests, for <br>
around 150 sovereigns<br>
<br>
The most expensive weapon in the game, but if you can afford it, this <br>
monstrous weapon is well worth it. If you're going to use a maul, make it <br>
this one - with the best overall damage performance of any two-hander in the <br>
game, there's not much the Chasind Great Maul isn't awesome at. 3 rune slots <br>
for great flexibility, enormous damage output, and mindblowing armour <br>
penetration, letting you crush Revenants like beer cans. The added stamina is <br>
also fantastic for making the most of the Two-Handed skillset's numerous <br>
spike damage talents. The only area where it's lacking is critical hit rate, <br>
but that's a small price to pay for the other stats on this beauty. The <br>
Chasind barbarians' utter lack of subtlety at its finest.<br>
<br>
<h4 id="bows">4.10 - Bows [DAOS4.10]</h4>

Bows of all types have (or should have) a stat modifier of 1.00. It's <br>
currently broken for crossbows, and will hopefully be fixed in a future <br>
patch. Bows also, unfortunately, never have rune slots. I'll include <br>
crossbows here in case BioWare fixes them or you happen to have a custom mod <br>
that makes Dexterity improve their damage the way it's supposed to.<br>
<br>
SHORTBOWS<br>
<br>
Defining characteristic: Very high rate of fire for excellent damage output, <br>
but only accurate at short range.<br>
<br>
Scout's Bow<br>
Damage varies with tier<br>
Critical Chance varies with tier<br>
Armour Penetration varies with tier<br>
Rapid Aim<br>
Dexterity requirement varies with tier<br>
Where to get it: in Dalish areas, typically<br>
<br>
The thing that makes these bows stand out is that they have Rapid Aim, which <br>
is quite uncommon on shortbows. Other than that, they're unremarkable.<br>
<br>
The Dark Moon<br>
Damage 8.00 (Tier 7)<br>
Critical Chance 1.60%<br>
Armour Penetration 6.60<br>
Optimal Range 26m<br>
+2 Willpower<br>
+10% Nature resistance<br>
+1.5 Armour penetration<br>
30 Dexterity required<br>
Where to get it: bought from Varathorn after completing a few storyline quests<br>
<br>
One of the only unique shortbows with stats that stand out in any particular <br>
way. Willpower is always a nice stat for archers due to all their sustaineds <br>
and the costs of their active talents, and armour penetration rarely goes <br>
amiss. Good to pair up with an Armsman's Tensioner or Camenae's Barbute.<br>
<br>
LONGBOWS<br>
<br>
Defining characteristic: Lower overall damage output than shortbows, but with <br>
more 'punch' per shot and far greater range. Intermediate between shortbows <br>
and crossbows in general characteristics.<br>
<br>
Falon'din's Reach<br>
Damage 9.60 (Tier 7)<br>
Critical Chance 1.60%<br>
Armour Penetration 8.80<br>
Optimal Range 46m<br>
+2 Damage<br>
Rapid Aim<br>
<br>
A decent all-around longbow with tier 7 stats and useful bonuses. Not much <br>
else to say here.<br>
<br>
Far Song<br>
Damage 9.60 (Tier 7)<br>
Critical Chance 1.60%<br>
Armour Penetration 8.80<br>
Optimal Range 46m<br>
+2 Damage<br>
Rapid Aim<br>
+3% Ranged critical chance<br>
+10 Attack<br>
+10% Critical/backstab damage<br>
34 Dexterity required<br>
Where to get it: from Owen's replacement in Redcliffe for around 120 sovereigns<br>
<br>
The definitive longbow of the game, Far Song's stats outclass just about <br>
every other bow out there. Comes with a hefty price tag, but if your PC is an <br>
archer, it's well worth the investment.<br>
<br>
Marjolaine's Recurve<br>
Damage 9.60 (Tier 7)<br>
Critical Chance 1.60%<br>
Armour Penetration 8.80<br>
Optimal Range 46m<br>
+3 Cunning<br>
+3 Damage<br>
Rapid Aim<br>
34 Dexterity required<br>
Leliana only<br>
Where to get it: Leliana's companion quest<br>
<br>
A bow that compliments Leliana's abilities very nicely, as the Cunning bonus <br>
boosts her bardic songs as well as her rogue abilities. Definitely worth <br>
getting for her if she's a staple party member, and it doesn't cost you a <br>
penny.<br>
<br>
Spear-Thrower<br>
Damage 9.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Critical Chance 1.50%<br>
Armour Penetration 8.00<br>
Optimal Range 44m<br>
Rapid Aim<br>
+2.5 Armour Penetration<br>
30 Dexterity required<br>
Where to get it: the Deep Roads<br>
<br>
A lesser cousin of those listed above, the Spear-Thrower is equippable a <br>
little earlier due to lower Dexterity requirements and still features the <br>
ever-useful Rapid Aim property.<br>
<br>
Crossbows<br>
<br>
Defining characteristic: Excellent damage per hit, range, armour penetration, <br>
and critical hit chance relative to other bows, but very slow rate of fire, <br>
and has Strength prerequisites to equip rather than Dexterity, resulting in a <br>
demanding stat spread to both equip them and have good damage.<br>
<br>
Antique Warden Crossbow<br>
Damage varies with tier (4-7)<br>
Critical Chance varies with tier<br>
Armour Penetration varies with tier<br>
+1 Damage<br>
Rapid Aim<br>
Strength requirement varies with tier<br>
Where to get it: Warden's Keep DLC<br>
<br>
One of the best crossbows in the game due to having Rapid Aim and having up <br>
to Tier 7 stats. It also seems to have a better version of Rapid Aim than <br>
other crossbows, making its rate of fire more competitive with longbows.<br>
<br>
Sailor's Crossbow<br>
Damage 12.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Critical Chance 3.00%<br>
Armour Penetration 10.00<br>
Range 50m<br>
Rapid Aim<br>
26 Strength required<br>
Where to get it: buy it from Barlin in Lothering<br>
<br>
The other crossbow with Rapid Aim. Since crossbows fire so slowly, having <br>
anything that boosts rate of fire is a real boon and has a very large effect <br>
on your damage output. This crossbow is quite nice because despite its high <br>
tier, it's available very early in the game. Seems to fire slower than the <br>
Antique Warden Crossbow, despite their Rapid Aim properties appearing <br>
identical in their item descriptions.<br>
<br>
<h4 id="dS">4.11 - Daggers and Staves [DAOS4.11]</h4><br>
<br>
DAGGERS<br>
<br>
All daggers have a stat modifier of 0.85.<br>
Defining characteristic: the quintessential 'offhand' weapon; high critical <br>
hit rate, great armour penetration, and high attack speed. Feeds off both STR <br>
and DEX rather than just STR for damage.<br>
<br>
Dead Thaig Shanker<br>
Damage 6.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Critical Chance 4.50%<br>
Armour Penetration 7.00<br>
2 rune slots<br>
+5 Cunning<br>
+0.5 Armour Penetrationv
+6 Attack<br>
Interrupts spellcasting<br>
26 Dexterity required<br>
Where to get it: Shale's quests<br>
<br>
A fantastic dagger for any melee rogue, as its bonuses tend to compliment <br>
their fighting style excellently. Particularly nice for melee-oriented Bards <br>
and anyone who loves ruining a mage's day, while also packing a better-than-<br>
normal punch against heavily armoured targets.<br>
<br>
The Rose's Thorn<br>
Damage 6.40 (Tier 7)<br>
Critical Chance 4.80%<br>
Armour Penetration 8.00<br>
3 rune slots<br>
+2 Dexterity<br>
+1 Health regeneration in combat<br>
+3 Damage<br>
+5% Melee critical chance<br>
+30% Critical/backstab damage<br>
30 Dexterity required<br>
Where to get it: buy from Garin in Orzammar for a little less than 150 <br>
sovereigns<br>
<br>
Though it comes with a whopping huge price tag (the second most expensive <br>
after the Chasind Great Maul), The Rose's Thorn is pretty much the definitive <br>
dagger in the game. Benefitting from the high base stats and 3 rune slots of <br>
Tier 7 gear, it also features some astonishingly good bonuses, most notably <br>
in the critical hit/backstab department. Laying the hurt as a melee rogue is <br>
almost too easy with this thing.<br>
<br>
Thorn of the Dead Gods<br>
Damage 6.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Critical Chance 4.50%<br>
Armour Penetration 7.00<br>
2 rune slots<br>
+3 Damage<br>
+3 Armour penetration<br>
26 Dexterity required<br>
Where to get it: a Deep Roads side quest<br>
<br>
A nice alternative to the Dead Thaig Shanker (or use them together), the <br>
Thorn of the Dead Gods is more oriented toward steady raw damage output <br>
across a wide variety of situations.<br>
<br>
MAGIC STAVES<br>
<br>
Staves feed off the Magic stat for prereqs and damage. They never miss unless <br>
blocked by inanimate obstructions, but also never score critical hits. The <br>
bolts they fire don't do much damage, and are always elemental - the element <br>
depends on the particular staff. They almost completely ignore armour, and <br>
never have weapon rune slots. They can only be equipped by Mages, and all <br>
staves come with an innate spellpower increase based on their tier - this <br>
bonus stacks with any spellpower bonuses on the weapon, e.g. a Tier 3 staff <br>
with +2 Spellpower as a bonus would give a total of +5 Spellpower to its <br>
wielder.<br>
<br>
Heaven's Wrath<br>
Damage 6.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Armour Penetration 35.00<br>
Range 56m<br>
Spellpower 6<br>
+1 Mana regeneration in combat<br>
+5 Spellpower<br>
+10% Electricity damage<br>
32 Magic required<br>
Where to get it: buy from Bodahn Feddic in Redcliffe after the final assault <br>
begins<br>
<br>
A nice all-around staff, particularly if you like laying Storms of the <br>
Century on your foes. Unfortunately, it's only available very late in the game.<br>
<br>
Staff of the Ephemeral Order<br>
Damage 6.00 (Tier 6)<br>
Armour Penetration 35.00<br>
Range 56m<br>
Spellpower 6<br>
+3 Willpower<br>
+5% Spirit damage<br>
32 Magic required<br>
Where to get it: buy from Alarith in the Alienage<br>
<br>
A good staff for a healer-type Mage that needs a good supply of mana, or for <br>
anyone who loves dropping Walking Bombs or Crushing Prisons on their foes. <br>
Not available until fairly late in the game.<br>
<br>
Staff of the Magister Lord<br>
Damage 6.40 (Tier 7)<br>
Armour Penetration 40.00<br>
Range 58m<br>
Spellpower 7<br>
+6 Willpower<br>
+2 Mana regeneration in combat<br>
+6 Spellpower<br>
+10% Fire damage<br>
+10% Spirit damage<br>
36 Magic required<br>
Where to get it: buy from the Templar quartermaster in the Circle tower for <br>
around 130 sovereigns<br>
<br>
This is pretty much the definitive staff in the game, with a correspondingly <br>
hefty price tag. If you can afford it, it's clearly the way to go - Tier 7 <br>
stats and bonuses that put your magical abilities through the roof.<br>
<br>
Winter's Breath<br>
Damage 6.40 (Tier 7)<br>
Armour Penetration 40.00<br>
Range 58m<br>
Spellpower 7<br>
+25% Cold resistance<br>
+3 Spellpower (Wonders of Thedas version only)<br>
+10% Cold damage<br>
Radiates Cold<br>
36 Magic required<br>
Where to get it: You can get a weaker version for free from Warden's Keep, or <br>
a stronger version for around 30 sovereigns or so from The Wonders of Thedas <br>
in Denerim.<br>
<br>
A good mid-game staff, particularly for Morrigan as she tends to orient <br>
toward cold-element spells in the Primal tree. If you have Warden's Keep, it <br>
has the additional benefit of not costing you anything and being acquirable <br>
quite early in the game, unlike the majority of Tier 7 staves.<br>
