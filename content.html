    <h3>Section I: General Starting Class Overview</h3>
    <p>
        This is just a very generalized overview to give some idea of what each class is all about. More details, such as what stats
        to prioritize or what exact abilities everyone gets, will be covered in later sections on actual character builds.
        I'm generally assuming that the reader already knows the basic mechanics of the game, such as what each stat does,
        what the difference between defense and armour is, what fatigue is, etc. If you don't, then you may want to read
        up on that first.
    </p>
    <h4 id="warrior">The Warrior [DAOS1.1]</h4>
    <p>
        Warriors are largely what you'd expect from an RPG - they are the most versatile weaponry specialists of any base class,
        able to learn all three melee styles (sword and shield, dual wielding, and two-handed weapons) as well as archery.
        Their class-specific talent tree allows them to make better use of heavier armour than anyone else, improves their
        performance when they're engaging large numbers of enemies, and gives them some control over the degree to which
        enemies will prioritize them as a target, which is particularly important for warriors filling the tank role. However,
        you shouldn't go into the warrior class expecting them to be the easiest class to play, as they tend to be in many
        other RPGs. Like rogues and mages, warriors require strategy to use well and can't simply go charging head-on into
        any battle they encounter, as tempting as that might be. In general, warriors will be at the forefront, but recklessness
        and/or lack of preparation can rapidly result in defeat and death. Pros: + High HP + Best heavy armour users + Large
        weapon selection + Work relatively well on AI 'auto-pilot' + Can achieve very high damage output across a wide variety
        of battlefield conditions Cons: - Smaller bag of tricks than the other classes - Greater need to manage stamina due
        to fatigue - Not as sturdy as warriors in a lot of RPGs; caution and tactics still required to survive - More one-dimensional
        than the other classes
    </p>
    <h4 id="rogue">1.2 - The Rogue [DAOS1.2]</h4>
    <p>
        Rogues provide a broad blend of damage, crowd control, support, and general utility. While not as sturdy or well suited to
        heavy armour as the warrior, rogues have a nice bag of tricks that gives them as much (or even more) survivability
        as their meaty frontline friends. Rogues probably require the most positional tactics of any class type, scouting
        ahead to clear out hazards or assassinate particularly dangerous targets before the rest of the group charges in,
        staying on the move and making use of battlefield positioning to maximize their impact. Rogues are more limited in
        their selection of fighting styles than warriors, typically using either dual wielding, archery, or some combination
        of the two. However, because of their class mechanics, rogues are generally regarded as being better than warriors
        at both of these styles of combat. There's almost never a time when you won't want at least one rogue in your group,
        if only to clear out traps and pick locks. Pros: + A lot of versatility in roles and combat style + Tons of utility
        + Great survivability if built correctly + Best skill users of any class Cons: - Generally relegated to using light
        armour - Less margin of error than warriors due to lower hp and less armour - Require somewhat more micromanagement
        than warriors to be effective - Limited weapon selection - Tend to be defensively weak and vulnerable in the early
        game
    </p>
    <h4 id="mage" 1.3 - The Mage [DAOS1.3] If you 've played BioWare RPGs before, you're probably expecting the mage to be a
        complete and utter powerhouse. If so, you guessed correctly. Mages have the most raw power of any class, in addition
        to having an enormous bag of tricks for keeping themselves alive against the odds and horribly incapacitating and mangling
        even the strongest enemies. Many of their spells are extremely potent on their own, but the spell combo mechanic can
        ramp up the destruction to even greater levels. For sheer battlefield control and dominance, nothing exceeds the potential
        of a mage. They also make excellent group support characters, and can even be melee tanks if you pick the Arcane Warrior
        specialization (more on that later). Pros: + Far and away the highest damage output of any class + The only class that
        can heal + Enormously potent spell combinations + Surprisingly high survivability and crowd control with the right spells
        + Can become the heaviest armour tanks in the game with the Arcane Warrior specialization Cons: - Require the most micromanagement
        of any class to be effective, unless you just use them as a healbot - Low hit point pool and poor armour, so positioning
        and defensive spells are necessary for survival - Very little equipment variety - Actually kind of too strong; have a
        lot of overpowered abilities and tricks that can trivialize encounters that would otherwise be very challenging. </p>

    <h3>Class Specializations</h3>
    <p>
        Class specializations become available at levels 7 and 14. All humanoid characters other than Sten can learn 2 specializations,
        though only the PC actually gets to pick both, as the others generally start with one. Level requirements for each
        talent are in parentheses.
    </p>

    <h4>2.1 - Warrior Specializations [DAOS2.1]</h4>
    <h5>CHAMPION</h5>
    <p>
        Source: Reward from Arl Eamon Bonuses: +2 Willpower,+1 Cunning The Champion specialization is a solid choice for almost any
        type of warrior, as it provides nice group buffing and crowd control abilities. It is particularly well suited to
        tanks, since they'll usually be in the thickest parts of the fight. This is the only warrior specialization that
        bolsters allies. Champion talents: War Cry (7) - An AoE attack debuff. Nothing spectacular on its own, though if
        you've got stamina to spare, it never hurts either. Rally (12) - A sustained AoE defense buff. Very handy for shieldtanks
        and for giving a survivability boost to any rogues in your party. The main downside is that it knocks allied rogues
        out of stealth when they enter its AoE, which I've always thought was bloody silly. Motivate (14) - Adds an attack
        buff to Rally. If you use Rally a lot, it's worth getting. Superiority (16) - Adds an AoE knockdown to War Cry, turning
        it from a mediocre debuff to a potent crowd control ability.
    </p>
    <h5>TEMPLAR</h5>
    <p>
        Source: Can either be acquired through a manual from Bodahn Feddic or taught by Alistair once his approval is high enough
        Bonuses: +2 Magic, +3 mental resistance The Templar specialization serves one role and one role only - anti-magic
        duties. Every ability they get is oriented toward countering magical enemies in some way or other. This is a common
        choice for heavy tanks, but can be useful for nearly any warrior, though less so for warrior archers due to some
        of their abilities being melee-based. Templar talents: Righteous Strike (7) - A passive ability that lets you drain
        mana from mages every time you hit them in melee. Sounds cool on paper, but to be honest I've never noticed it making
        much of a difference. Cleanse Area (9) - The most useful Templar ability. This is basically an AoE dispel, allowing
        you to get rid of a lot of nasty status effects and other damaging and/or incapacitating magical afflictions. Mental
        Fortress (12) - A permanent passive bonus to mental resistance. Fairly useful, since warriors tend not to have very
        good mental resistance, but I wouldn't make it a priority. Holy Smite (15) - A small AoE attack that does damage
        based on your Willpower and can also be stunned or knocked back. Kind of limited in usefulness unless you have very
        high Willpower. Mainly designed to be used against mages, as it drains mana from them and inflicts additional spirit
        damage based on the amount of mana drained. This would be kind of a useless ability if mages weren't so ungodly powerful;
        killing enemy mages as soon as possible is usually a good strategy in any fight, so this talent may be worth taking
        to accomplish that, though I find the damage a bit underwhelming for its cost, even with a decent Willpower modifier.
    </p>
    <h5>BERSERKER</h5>
    <p>
        Source: Can be learned either from a manual bought from Gorim, or taught by Oghren once his approval is high enough ADDENDUM
        (from S. Baker): you can also learn the Berserker specialization through a course of action during the random encounter
        with the incompetent ambushers - listen to them natter for a bit, and then charge them to spring your own ambush.
        Apparently there's things like this for learning some of the other specializations; as I learn them, I'll add them.
        Bonuses: +2 Strength, +10 hit points Berserker is the DPS warrior specialization. The entire purpose of the abilities
        gained is to boost your damage output, so it's generally the clear choice for 2h or dual wielding warriors. Unlike
        in many games, Berserkers in DA:O don't have to sacrifice survivability in exchange for this damage. Just watch your
        stamina early on. Berserker talents: Berserk (7) - a sustained ability that boosts your damage and mental resistance,
        but imposes a penalty on your stamina regeneration. In general, there's no reason why a Berserker should ever not
        have this on in combat. The major drawback is its obnoxiously long cooldown. Resilience (8) - contrary to the in-game
        description, this talent actually boosts your health regeneration while Berserk is active. Worth getting. Constraint
        (10) - neutralizes the stamina regeneration penalty from Berserk while it's active, meaning there's even less reason
        not to have it active in combat. Final Blow (12) - uses all of your stamina to unleash one big attack. Does 1 damage
        for every 2 stamina spent. Kind of situational, and be aware that it can miss just like any other attack.
    </p>
    <h5>REAVER</h5>
    <p>
        Source: Taught by Kolgrim if you defile Andraste's ashes Bonuses: +1 constitution, +5 stamina Reaver is probably the least
        useful of the warrior specializations, having rather situational abilities and somewhat lesser stat bonuses. Reaver
        can be a decent choice for tanks and damage dealers. Devour (7) - consumes nearby corpses, and restores health, with
        the amount based on your Magic stat, like health poultices. Probably the most useful Reaver talent. Frightening Appearance
        (12) - causes your target to cower in fear if they fail a mental resistance check, and also boosts the effectiveness
        of Taunt and Threaten. Pretty useful for tanks. Aura of Pain (14) - an AoE DoT that hurts both you and enemies within
        range with each pulse. Considering it hurts you for the same amount as it hurts them, and also imposes a penalty
        on your health regeneration, this is far from a great ability. Tanks don't really want to be dropping their own hp
        and regen rate, and since it's an AoE, it'll tend to attract hostility toward DPS warriors. Kind of useless. Blood
        Frenzy (16) - Adds between 0 and 10 damage depending on how low your health is, and imposes a penalty to health regeneration.
        Basically a really shoddy version of Berserk.
    </p>
    <h4>2.2 - Rogue Specializations [DAOS2.2]</h4>
    <h5>ASSASSIN</h5>
    <p>
        Source: Can either be learned from a manual bought from Alarith, or taught by Zevran once his approval is high enough Bonuses:
        +2 Dexterity, +2.5% melee critical hit chance Assassin is a great choice for any melee rogue, since it gets really
        useful stat bonuses and a talent set oriented toward maximizing your damage output. Not so useful for rogue archers.
        Assassin talents: Mark of Death (7) - a targeted debuff that increases all incoming damage against the afflicted
        enemy. Great for dropping priority targets faster, like mages and bosses. Exploit Weakness (12) - adds a passive
        damage bonus to every backstab hit based on your Cunning score. Since you probably have a pretty high Cunning modifier
        as a rogue, this is a solid investment. Lacerate (14) - causes your backstabs to inflict a non-stacking DoT. More
        damage means a target that's dead sooner, particularly against tougher enemies. Feast of the Fallen (16) - passively
        allows you to regain stamina any time you kill an enemy with a backstab. Note that this only works for true backstabs
        where you're flanking the enemy, and not Coup de Grace hits from the front against incapacitated enemies. If you
        find yourself getting low on stamina early on in battles, this is worth considering.
    </p>
    <h5>BARD</h5>
    <p>
        Source: Can either be learned from a manual bought from Alimar, or taught by Leliana once her approval is high enough Bonuses:
        +2 Willpower, +1 Cunning The Bard specialization allows rogues to take on more of a group buffing role. Because their
        buffs automatically affect the whole party no matter where they are, unlike Champion buffs which are a circular AoE,
        this pairs up particularly well with ranged fighting styles. A solid choice for any rogue looking to play more of
        a support role. The effect of all Bard songs are based on Cunning. Bards can only have one song active at a time.
        Bard talents: Song of Valour (7) - a sustained party buff that boosts stamina and mana regeneration. Extremely useful
        in nearly every situation. Distraction (8) - a sustained ability that decreases hostility and can disorient enemies
        that fail a mental resistance check. Pretty situational and generally not necessary. Song of Courage (10) - a sustained
        party buff that boosts attack, damage, and critical hit chance. A good choice if you have a melee-heavy party that
        just wants to mow through grunts quickly. Captivating Song (12) - a sustained ability that continually inflicts a
        weak stun against all enemies in an AoE around the bard. While using this song, you can't move, attack, or use any
        other abilities. Useful if you get swarmed, but not something you'd want on all the time.
        <h5>DUELIST</h5> Source: Taught by Isabela at The Pearl Bonuses: +2 Dexterity, +1 damage Duelist is an amazing specialization,
        providing extremely useful bonuses for any type of rogue, though particularly for melee rogues. Provides a great
        blend of offensive and defensive capabilities. Duelist talents: Dueling (7) - a sustained ability that grants a bonus
        to attack. Particularly useful in the early game, and for making archery more reliable. Upset Balance (12) - a targeted
        melee debuff that lowers the defense and movement speed of an enemy Keen Defenses (14) - grants a bonus to defense
        when Dueling is active. Since rogues generally rely on defense dodging to survive, this is almost always useful.
        Pinpoint Strike (16) - an activated self-buff that turns all melee attacks into critical hits for a short time. Quite
        useful when fighting shield users that are immune to flanking or any other time when backstabs are not possible.
    </p>
    <h5>RANGER</h5>
    <p>
        Source: Learned from a manual you can purchase from Bodahn Feddic Bonuses: +1 Constitution, +5% Nature resistance Ranger
        is the most unusual rogue specialization, as it is purely pet-based with no abilities that the character themself
        actually uses. If you like summoning classes, this is the specialization for you. Pets can provide additional damage
        and abilities and/or act as disposable tanks. Rangers also pair up well with Blood Mages (explained in the Mage Specializations
        below). The drawbacks are the mediocre stat bonuses and the fact that if a summoned animal gets a killing blow, your
        party receives no exp for the kill. Summon Wolf (7) - summons a wolf. Can howl, which is an AoE defense debuff. Summon
        Bear (8) - summons a bear. Can slam, which is an automatic critical if it hits and may knock the target back. Summon
        Spider (10) - summons a giant spider (noticing a pattern?). Can use Web, which immobilizes an enemy, and Spit Poison,
        a ranged attack that inflicts a Nature DoT. Master Ranger (12) - Gives a power boost to all your summons, so you
        should get it if you use your summons regularly. The wolf becomes a blight wolf, the bear becomes a great bear, and
        the spider becomes a poison spider.
    </p>
    <h4>2.3 - Mage Specializations [DAOS2.3]</h4>
    <h5>SHAPESHIFTER</h5>
    <p>
        Source: Can either be learned from a manual bought from Varathorn, or taught by Morrigan if her approval rating is Neutral.
        Bonuses: +2 Constitution, +1 Armour The Shapeshifter specialization is one that had a lot of cool potential but unfortunately
        fell short in practice. While each of the abilities is useful in its own right, the long casting time on shapeshifting
        and the extreme reduction in tactical options (you can't use any of your spells) while shifted make it the least
        useful of the mage specializations. Shapeshifter talents: Spider Shape (7) - caster becomes a giant spider, gaining
        the Web (single target paralysis) and Spit Poison (ranged DoT) abilities as well as Nature resistance Bear Shape
        (8) - caster becomes a bear, gaining a bonus to armour and Nature resistance as well as the Slam (critical hit/knockback)
        and Rage (damage self-buff) abilities Flying Swarm (10) - caster becomes a swarm of winged stinging insects that
        inflict Nature damage based on the caster's spellpower. Mana regeneration drops to 0, and any damage the swarm takes
        is removed from mana instead of hit points. The swarm is immune to normal missiles and has high evasion versus melee
        attacks, but is very vulnerable to fire. Master Shapeshifter (12) - boosts the capabilities of each shifter form.
        Spider becomes Corrupted Spider and gains the Overwhelm attack; bear becomes a Bereskarn and gains the Overwhelm
        attack; and the Flying Swarm gains health with every attack.
    </p>
    <h5>ARCANE WARRIOR</h5>
    <p>
        Learned from a spirit in the ruined temple of the Brecilian Forest Bonuses: +1 Dexterity, +5 attack The most unusual of the
        mage specializations. Basically allows you to become a heavy melee fighter with unsurpassed defensive potential,
        but with greatly diminished active spellcasting ability due to massively boosted fatigue. Arcane Warrior talents:
        Combat Magic (7) - a sustained self-buff that lets you use your Magic stat rather than Strength to determine weapon
        damage (while active) and to satisfy weapon and armour prerequisites (passively once Combat Magic is learned). Also
        gives up to +10 attack based on your spellpower. Greatly boosts fatigue. Aura of Might (12) - adds bonuses to attack,
        defense, and damage while Combat Magic is active. This is pretty essential - learn ASAP. Shimmering Shield (14) -
        the best defensive self-buff in the game, Shimmering Shield is a sustained ability that grants a sizeable bonus to
        armour, and adds 75 points to all resistances except spell resistance (note that 75% is where elemental resistances
        are capped, but mental and physical resistance can go up to 100). Imposes a heavy penalty on mana regeneration. As
        of patch 1.02, it will deactivate once mana reaches 0. Try and have this up as much as possible. Fade Shroud (16)
        - grants a small bonus to mana regeneration and a 25% chance to avoid incoming attacks while Combat Magic is active.
        Another essential skill that should be learned right away.
    </p>
    <h5>BLOOD MAGE</h5>
    <p>
        Source: Taught by the Desire demon possessing Connor Bonuses: +2 Constitution, +2 spellpower Unbeatable for sheer offensive
        potential, Blood Mage is the way to go if you want your mage to just be a spellcasting powerhouse. Be cautious when
        using Blood abilities, though, as they have significant penalties that can result in disaster if employed at inopportune
        times. If you like to nuke things into oblivion while hanging well back from the front lines, this specialization
        was made for you. Blood Mage talents: Blood Magic (7) - a sustained self-buff that uses hit points rather than mana
        to cast spells, and reduces the effectiveness of any healing spells or items used on you to 10% of their normal strength.
        The health cost of the spell is 20% lower than its mana cost, and can be further reduced by Blood Mage- specific
        items found in the game. Blood Sacrifice (12) - heals the caster by sucking life force out of an ally. Can only be
        used when Blood Magic is active, and does not suffer the 90% healing penalty, but can kill the ally. A ranger's pets
        can be used as a 'battery' of sorts for a Blood Mage ally with this ability. It's easier to manage than it sounds,
        as damage to your ally never exceeds 50 points, and you gain 2 hit points for every 1 drained. Blood Wound (14) -
        one of the most powerful crowd control spells in the game, Blood Wound paralyzes all enemies in a large AoE and inflicts
        a very strong DoT. Since Blood Mages tend to stack their Magic stat, this is nearly impossible to resist. Blood Magic
        must be active, and enemies without blood (such as golems) are unaffected. Used wisely, this attack can turn normally
        difficult encounters into a joke. Blood Control (16) - allows you to turn an enemy into a temporary ally if they
        fail a mental resistance check. Depends on whether or not these abilities are your cup of tea.
    </p>
    <h5>SPIRIT HEALER</h5>
    <p>
        Source: Learned from a tome that can be bought either in The Wonders of Thedas or outside Warden's Keep. Contrary to what
        you'd expect, Wynne cannot teach it. Bonuses: +2 Magic, bonus to combat health regen The most support-oriented of
        the mage specializations, Spirit Healer is a solid choice for nearly any kind of mage, whether it's making you a
        better healer than you already are or giving you the option of being a great healer if things take a turn for the
        worse. The bonuses are great and the spells are all useful. Spirit Healers are the only characters other than Shale
        in statue mode that can heal more than one character at a time. Group Heal (7) - heals everyone in your group, regardless
        of how spread out they are. Extremely useful, particularly when recovering from a large AoE attack like a fireball.
        Revival (8) - this spell is the only way to revive an ally in combat. Usually not necessary, but always nice to have
        as an option. Lifeward (12) - places a latent buff on the recipient that instantly heals them for a decent amount
        whenever their hit points fall below 1/3 of their maximum. A good spell to throw on your tank in any tough fight.
        Cleansing Aura (14) - a sustained AoE buff centred on the caster that sends out pulses of healing energy to all allies
        in the area, with the heal amount decreasing as allies move further away. Also heals all injuries of allies in close
        proximity. Good for saving money on injury kits and in battles where your characters tend to stay tightly grouped,
        but you don't want to leave it running as it drains mana very quickly.
